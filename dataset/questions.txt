After some research I found that two practical approaches exists for this.</p>\n\n<p>One is using a tree structure just as the previous one. The drawback of this structure is that you need a ton of tweaking/hacks to get the multi-module reporting work well with Maven. Another downside is that in Subversion the standard trunk/tags/branches approach add even more complexity to the repository.</p>\n\n<p>The other approach uses a flat structure, where there are only one parent project and all the modules, submodules and parts-of-the-submodules are a direct child of the parent project. This approach works well for reporting and is easier in Subversion, however I feel I lose a bit of the structure this way.</p>\n\n<p>Which way would you choose in the long term and why?</p>\n'}
{'questionId': '20034', 'question': '<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Darkstar" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Project Darkstar</a> was the topic of the monthly <a href="http://www.javasig.com/meeting/home.xhtml" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JavaSIG</a> meeting down at the Google offices in NYC last night.  For those that don\'t know (probably everyone), Project Darkstar is a framework for massively multiplayer online games that attempts to take care of all of the "hard stuff."  The basic idea is that you write your game server logic in such a way that all operations are broken up into tiny tasks.  You pass these tasks to the Project Darkstar framework which handles distributing them to a specific node in the cluster, any concurrency issues, and finally persisting the data.</p>\n\n<p>Apparently doing this kind of thing is a much different problem for video games than it is for enterprise applications.  Jim Waldo, who gave the lecture, claims that MMO games have a DB read/write ratio of 50/50, whereas enterprise apps are more like 90% read, 10% write.  He also claims that most existing MMOs keep everything in memory exlcusively, and only dump to a DB every 6 hours of so.  This means if a server goes down, you would lose all of the work since the last DB dump.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the project itself sounds really cool, but I don\'t think the industry will accept it.  First, you have to write your server code in Java.  The client code can be written in anything (Jim claims ActionScript 3 is the most popular, follow by C++), but the server stuff has to be Java.  Sounds good to me, but I really get the impression that everyone in the games industry hates Java.</p>\n\n<p>Second, unlike other industries where developers prefer to use existing frameworks and libraries, the guys in the games industry seem to like to write everything themselves.  Not only that, they like to rewrite everything for every new game they produce.  Things are starting to change where developers are using Havok for physics, Unreal Engine 3 as their platform, etc., but for the most part it looks like everything is still proprietary.</p>\n\n<p>So, are the guys at Project Darkstar just wasting their time?  Can a general framework like this really work for complex games with the performance that is required?  Even if it does work, are game companies willing to use it?</p>\n'}

{'questionId': '33497', 'question': '<p>Unchecked exceptions are alright if you want to handle every failure the same way, for example by logging it and skipping to the next request, displaying a message to the user and handling the next event, etc. If this is my use case, all I have to do is catch some general exception type at a high level in my system, and handle everything the same way.</p>\n\n<p>But I want to recover from specific problems, and I\'m not sure the best way to approach it with unchecked exceptions. Here is a concrete example.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose I have a web application, built using Struts2 and Hibernate. If an exception bubbles up to my "action", I log it, and display a pretty apology to the user. But one of the functions of my web application is creating new user accounts, that require a unique user name. If a user picks a name that already exists, Hibernate throws an <code>org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException</code> (an unchecked exception) down in the guts of my system. I\'d really like to recover from this particular problem by asking the user to choose another user name, rather than giving them the same "we logged your problem but for now you\'re hosed" message.</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few points to consider:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There a lot of people creating accounts simultaneously. I don\'t want to lock the whole user table between a "SELECT" to see if the name exists and an "INSERT" if it doesn\'t. In the case of relational databases, there might be some tricks to work around this, but what I\'m really interested in is the general case where pre-checking for an exception won\'t work because of a fundamental race condition. Same thing could apply to looking for a file on the file system, etc.</li>\n<li>Given my CTO\'s propensity for drive-by management induced by reading technology columns in "Inc.", I need a layer of indirection around the persistence mechanism so that I can throw out Hibernate and use Kodo, or whatever, without changing anything except the lowest layer of persistence code. As a matter of fact, there are several such layers of abstraction in my system. How can I prevent them from leaking in spite of unchecked exceptions?</li>\n<li>One of the declaimed weaknesses of checked exceptions is having to "handle" them in every call on the stack&mdash;either by declaring that a calling method throws them, or by catching them and handling them. Handling them often means wrapping them in another checked exception of a type appropriate to the level of abstraction. So, for example, in checked-exception land, a file-system&ndash;based implementation of my UserRegistry might catch <code>IOException</code>, while a database implementation would catch <code>SQLException</code>, but both would throw a <code>UserNotFoundException</code> that hides the underlying implementation. How do I take advantage of unchecked exceptions, sparing myself of the burden of this wrapping at each layer, without leaking implementation details?</li>\n</ol>\n'}

Most of the files above the 4GB limit would be large HD video files (its for a video editing company).  These will be downloaded by users across the internet, this isn\'t going to be people on a local network.  We want the files to be available via HTTP (some users are going to be behind firewalls that aren\'t going to allow FTP, Bittorrent, etc.).  The will be a library of files the end user could download, so we aren\'t talking about a one time large download.  The will be download different large files on a semi-regular basis.</p>\n\n<p>So far Vault that @Edmund-Tay suggested is the closest solution so far.  The only problem is that it doesn\'t work for files larger than 4GB (it instantly fails before starting the download, they are probably using a 32bit integer somewhere that the content length of the file exceeds).</p>\n\n<p>A java applet (or ActiveX component since the problem only exist in IE) that worked like the article @spoulson linked to would be the best solution, but so far I haven\'t had any luck finding one that does anything like that (multipart downloads, resume, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>It looks like we might have to write our own.  Another option would be to write a .Net application (maybe ClickOnce) that is associated with an extension or mime type.  Then the user would actually be downloading a small file from the web server that opens in the exe/ClickOnce app that tells the application what file to download.  That is how the MSDN downloader works.  The end user would then only have to download/install an EXE once.  That would be better than downloading an exe every time they wanted to download a large file.</p>\n'}

{'questionId': '42828', 'question': "<p>I will elaborate somewhat. Jsf is kind-of extremely painful for working with from designer's perspective, somewhat in the range of trying to draw a picture while having hands tied at your back, but it is good for chewing up forms and listing lots of data. So sites we are making in my company are jsf admin pages and jsp user pages. Problem occurs when user pages have some complicated forms and stuff and jsf starts kickin' in. </p>\n\n<p>Here is the question: I'm on pure jsp page. I need to access some jsf page that uses session bean. How can I initialize that bean? If I was on jsf page, I could have some commandLink which would prepare data. Only thing I can come up with is having dummy jsf page that will do the work and redirect me to needed jsf page, but that's kind of ugly, and I don't want to end up with 50 dummy pages. I would rather find some mechanism to reinitialize bean that is already in session with some wanted parameters.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: some more details. In this specific situation, I have a tests that are either full or filtered. It's a same test with same logic and everything, except if test is filtered, it should eliminate some questions depending on answers. Upon a clicking a link, it should start a requested test in one of the two modes. Links are parts of main menu-tree and are visible on many sibling jsp pages. My task is to have 4 links: testA full, testA filtered, testB full, testB filtered, that all lead on same jsf page and TestFormBean should be reinitialized accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I've researched facelets a bit, and while it won't help me now, I'll definitely keep that in mind for next project.</p>\n"}

{'questionId': '51266', 'question': "<p>I have an application that's a mix of Java and C++ on Solaris. The Java aspects of the code run the web UI and establish state on the devices that we're talking to, and the C++ code does the real-time crunching of data coming back from the devices. Shared memory is used to pass device state and context information from the Java code through to the C++ code. The Java code uses a PostgreSQL database to persist its state.</p>\n\n<p>We're running into some pretty severe performance bottlenecks, and right now the only way we can scale is to increase memory and CPU counts. We're stuck on the one physical box due to the shared memory design.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The really big hit here is being taken by the C++ code. The web interface is fairly lightly used to configure the devices; where we're really struggling is to handle the data volumes that the devices deliver once configured.</p>\n\n<p>Every piece of data we get back from the device has an identifier in it which points back to the device context, and we need to look that up. Right now there's a series of shared memory objects that are maintained by the Java/UI code and referred to by the C++ code, and that's the bottleneck. Because of that architecture we cannot move the C++ data handling off to another machine. We need to be able to scale out so that various subsets of devices can be handled by different machines, but then we lose the ability to do that context lookup, and that's the problem I'm trying to resolve: how to offload the real-time data processing to other boxes while still being able to refer to the device context.</p>\n\n<p>I should note we have no control over the protocol used by the devices themselves, and there is no possible chance that situation will change.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>We know we need to move away from this to be able to scale out by adding more machines to the cluster, and I'm in the early stages of working out exactly how we'll do this.</p>\n\n<p>Right now I'm looking at Terracotta as a way of scaling out the Java code, but I haven't got as far as working out how to scale out the C++ to match.</p>\n\n<p>As well as scaling for performance we need to consider high availability as well. The application needs to be available pretty much the whole time -- not absolutely 100%, which isn't cost effective, but we need to do a reasonable job of surviving a machine outage.</p>\n\n<p>If you had to undertake the task I've been given, what would you do?</p>\n\n<p><em>EDIT: Based on the data provided by @john channing, i'm looking at both GigaSpaces and Gemstone.

One is Microsoft FTP, the other I'm uncertain on but is definitely not Microsoft.</p>\n\n<p>Any idea what could cause an FTP client to timeout when waiting for a NLST response on an empty directory?  The visible responses from the FTP server appear to be the same, but is there a difference in how NLST responds for an empty directory that I'm unaware of?</p>\n\n<p>This problem is consistent on these two servers.

{'questionId': '61150', 'question': '<p>My motto for Java is "just because Java has static blocks, it doesn\'t mean that you should be using them." Jokes aside, there are a lot of tricks in Java that make testing a nightmare. Two of the most I hate are Anonymous Classes and Static Blocks. We have a lot of legacy code that make use of Static Blocks and these are one of the annoying points in our push in writing unit tests. Our goal is to be able to write unit tests for classes that depend on this static initialization with minimal code changes. </p>\n\n<p>So far my suggestion to my colleagues is to move the body of the static block into a private static method and call it <code>staticInit</code>. This method can then be called from within the static block. For unit testing another class that depends on this class could easily mock <code>staticInit</code> with JMockit to not do anything. Let\'s see this in example.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ClassWithStaticInit {\n  static {\n    System.out.println("static initializer.");\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Will be changed to</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ClassWithStaticInit {\n  static {\n    staticInit();\n  }\n\n  private static void staticInit() {\n    System.out.println("static initialized.");\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So that we can do the following in a JUnit.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class DependentClassTest {\n  public static class MockClassWithStaticInit {\n    public static void staticInit() {\n    }\n  }\n\n  @BeforeClass\n  public static void setUpBeforeClass() {\n    Mockit.redefineMethods(ClassWithStaticInit.class, MockClassWithStaticInit.class);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However this solution also comes with its own problems. You can\'t run <code>DependentClassTest</code> and <code>ClassWithStaticInitTest</code> on the same JVM since you actually want the static block to run for <code>ClassWithStaticInitTest</code>.</p>\n\n<p>What would be your way of accomplishing this task?
