{'answer': "<p>I'll add to the excellent answers given above, and talk about boxing and unboxing, and how this applies to Java (although C# has it too). I'll use just Java terminology, because I am more <em>au fait</em> with that.</p>\n\n<p>As the answers mentioned, <code>int</code> is just a number (called the <em>unboxed</em> type), whereas <code>Integer</code> is an object (which contains the number, hence a <em>boxed</em> type). In Java terms, that means (apart from not being able to call methods on <code>int</code>), you cannot store <code>int</code> or other non-object types in collections (<code>List</code>, <code>Map</code>, etc.). In order to store them, you must first box them up in its corresponding boxed type.</p>\n\n<p>Java 5 onwards have something called <em>auto-boxing</em> and <em>auto-unboxing</em> which allow the boxing/unboxing to be done behind the scenes. Compare and contrast: Java 5 version:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Deque&lt;Integer&gt; queue;\n\nvoid add(int n) {\n    queue.add(n);\n}\n\nint remove() {\n    return queue.remove();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Java 1.4 or earlier (no generics either):</p>\n\n<pre><code>Deque queue;\n\nvoid add(int n) {\n    queue.add(Integer.valueOf(n));\n}\n\nint remove() {\n    return ((Integer) queue.remove()).intValue();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It must be noted that despite the brevity in the Java 5 version, both versions generate identical bytecode. Thus, although auto-boxing and auto-unboxing is very convenient because you write less code, these operations <em>do</em> happen behind the scenes, with the same runtime costs, so you still have to be aware of their existence.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>\n", 'questionId': '564', 'answerId': '608'}

My understanding is that once it gets to a system loadLibrary call (i.e. Java has found the library in its java.library.path and is now telling the OS to load it) - it is completely dependent on the operating system to find any dependent libraries, because at that point it is the operating system that is loading the library for the process, and the OS only knows how to look in the system path. That seems hard to set in the case of a Webstart app, but there is a way around this that does not involve static compiling. You may be able to shuffle where your libraries are - I am unsure </p>\n\n<p>If you use a custom classloader, you can override loadLibrary and findLibrary so that it can locate your libraries from within a jar in your classpath, and if you also make it aware of your native library dependencies (i.e. libB depends on libA depends on libX, then when loading libB you can catch yourself and ensure you load libA first, and in checking that notice and load libX first.

Basically, there are two parts of every <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/math/MathContext.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>MathContext</code></a>.  There\'s a precision, and there\'s also a <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/math/RoundingMode.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>RoundingMode</code></a>.</p>\n\n<p>The precision again specifies the number of significant digits.  So if you specify <code>123</code> as a number, and ask for 2 significant digits, you\'re going to get <code>120</code>.  It might be clearer if you think in terms of scientific notation.</p>\n\n<p><code>123</code> would be <code>1.23e2</code> in scientific notation.  If you only keep 2 significant digits, then you get <code>1.2e2</code>, or <code>120</code>.  By reducing the number of significant digits, we reduce the precision with which we can specify a number.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>RoundingMode</code> part specifies how we should handle the loss of precision.  To reuse the example, if you use <code>123</code> as the number, and ask for 2 significant digits, you\'ve reduced your precision.  With a <code>RoundingMode</code> of <code>HALF_UP</code> (the default mode), <code>123</code> will become <code>120</code>.  With a <code>RoundingMode</code> of <code>CEILING</code>, you\'ll get <code>130</code>.</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>System.out.println(new BigDecimal("123.4",\n                   new MathContext(4,RoundingMode.HALF_UP)));\nSystem.out.println(new BigDecimal("123.4",\n                   new MathContext(2,RoundingMode.HALF_UP)));\nSystem.out.println(new BigDecimal("123.4",\n                   new MathContext(2,RoundingMode.CEILING)));\nSystem.out.println(new BigDecimal("123.4",\n                   new MathContext(1,RoundingMode.CEILING)));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Outputs:</p>\n\n<pre><code>123.4\n1.2E+2\n1.3E+2\n2E+2\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can see that both the precision and the rounding mode affect the output.</p>\n', 'questionId': '7539', 'answerId': '7561'}
{'answer': "<p>Class names should always be descriptive and self-explanatory.

{'answer': "<p>Use packages to group related functionality together.</p>\n\n<p>Usually the top of your package tree is your domain name reversed (<code>com.domain.subdomain</code>) to guarantee uniqueness, and then usually there will be a package for your application.

These names can get pretty long, but <code>import</code> keeps them all at the top of files and IDEs can help to manage that as well.</p>\n\n<p>Exceptions usually go in the same package as the classes that throw them, so if you had, say, <code>FileStorageException</code> it would go in the same package as <code>FileStorageStrategy</code>.

{'answer': u"<p>I found the information based on Kevin Kenny's answer, but I figured I'd post it here for others.</p>\n\n<p>A WSDL document defines services as collections of network endpoints, or ports. In WSDL, the abstract definition of endpoints and messages is separated from their concrete network deployment or data format bindings. This allows the reuse of abstract definitions: messages, which are abstract descriptions of the data being exchanged, and port types which are abstract collections of operations. The concrete protocol and data format specifications for a particular port type constitutes a reusable binding. A port is defined by associating a network address with a reusable binding, and a collection of ports define a service. Hence, a WSDL document uses the following elements in the definition of network services:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Types</strong>\u2013 a container for data type definitions using some type system (such as XSD).</li>\n<li><strong>Message</strong>\u2013 an abstract, typed definition of the data being communicated.</li>\n<li><strong>Operation</strong>\u2013 an abstract description of an action supported by the service.</li>\n<li><strong>Port Type</strong>\u2013an abstract set of operations supported by one or more endpoints.</li>\n<li><strong>Binding</strong>\u2013 a concrete protocol and data format specification for a particular port type.</li>\n<li><strong>Port</strong>\u2013 a single endpoint defined as a combination of a binding and a network address.</li>\n<li><strong>Service</strong>\u2013 a collection of related endpoints.</li>\n</ul>\n", 'questionId': '11561', 'answerId': '11639'}

{'answer': '<p>Well, since you can not have one part OSGi and one part non-OSGi you\'ll need to make your entire app OSGi.

Identifying these purely by hand can range from rather straightforward for a well designed highly cohesive but loosely coupled application to a nightmare for interlocked source code that you are not familiar with.</p>\n\n<p>Some help can come from tools like <a href="http://clarkware.com/software/JDepend.html" rel="noreferrer">JDepend</a> which can show you the coupling of Java packages against other packages/classes in your system.

{'answer': '<p><strong>1. Add a Subject Line</strong> </p>\n\n<p>You can prefill the subject line in the email by adding the subject preceded by \'<strong>?subject=</strong>\' after the email address. </p>\n\n<p>So the link now becomes: </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;a href="mailto:someone@yoursite.com?subject=Mail from Our Site"&gt;Email Us&lt;/a&gt; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>2. Send to Multiple Recipients</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Mail can be sent to additional recipients either as carbon copies (cc) or blind carbon copies (bcc). </p>\n\n<p>This is done in a similar way, by placing \'<strong>?cc=someoneelse@theirsite.com</strong>\' after the initial address. </p>\n\n<p>So the link looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;a href="mailto:someone@yoursite.com?cc=someoneelse@theirsite.com"&gt;Email Us&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>cc can simply be replaced by bcc if you wish to send blind carbon copies. </p>\n\n<p>This can be very useful if you have links on pages with different subjects. You might have the email on each page go to the appropriate person in a company but with a copy of all mails sent to a central address also. </p>\n\n<p>You can of course specify more than one additional recipient, just separate your list of recipients with a comma. </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;a href="mailto:someone@yoursite.com?cc=someoneelse@theirsite.com, another@thatsite.com, me@mysite.com"&gt;Email Us&lt;/a&gt; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Sourced from <a href="http://www.outfront.net/tutorials_02/adv_tech/mailto.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Getting More From \'mailto\'</a> which now 404s.

Write the Email</strong> </p>\n\n<p>You can also prefill the body of the email with the start of a message, or write the whole message if you like! To add some thing to the body of the email it is again as simple as above - \'<strong>?body=</strong>\' after the email address. However formatting that email can be a little tricky. To create spaces between words you will have to use hex code - for example \'<strong>%20</strong>\' between each word, and to create new lines will mean adding \'<strong>%0D</strong>\'.

{'answer': "<p>There are drawbacks of using reference counting. One of the most mentioned is circular references: Suppose A references B, B references C and C references B. If A were to drop its reference to B, both B and C will still have a reference count of 1 and won't be deleted with traditional reference counting. CPython (reference counting is not part of python itself, but part of the C implementation thereof) catches circular references with a separate garbage collection routine that it runs periodically...</p>\n\n<p>Another drawback: Reference counting can make execution slower. Each time an object is referenced and dereferenced, the interpreter/VM must check to see if the count has gone down to 0 (and then deallocate if it did). Garbage Collection does not need to do this.</p>\n\n<p>Also, Garbage Collection can be done in a separate thread (though it can be a bit tricky). On machines with lots of RAM and for processes that use memory only slowly, you might not want to be doing GC at all!

However, one big difference between the Java and Python approaches is that with reference counting in the common case (no circular references) objects are cleaned up immediately rather than at some indeterminate later date.</p>\n\n<p>For example, I can write sloppy, non-portable code in CPython such as</p>\n\n<pre><code>def parse_some_attrs(fname):\n    return open(fname).read().split("~~~")[2:4]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and the file descriptor for that file I opened will be cleaned up immediately because as soon as the reference to the open file goes away, the file is garbage collected and the file descriptor is freed.  Of course, if I run Jython or IronPython or possibly PyPy, then the garbage collector won\'t necessarily run until much later; possibly I\'ll run out of file descriptors first and my program will crash.</p>\n\n<p>So you SHOULD be writing code that looks like</p>\n\n<pre><code>def parse_some_attrs(fname):\n    with open(fname) as f:\n        return f.read().split("~~~")[2:4]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but sometimes people like to rely on reference counting to always free up their resources because it can sometimes make your code a little shorter.</p>\n\n<p>I\'d say that the best garbage collector is the one with the best performance, which currently seems to be the Java-style generational garbage collectors that can run in a separate thread and has all these crazy optimizations, etc.  The differences to how you write your code should be negligible and ideally non-existent.</p>\n', 'questionId': '21934', 'answerId': '22219'}

{'answer': '<p>We run DB40 .NET version in a large client/server project.</p>\n\n<p>Our experiences is that you can potentially get much better performance than typical relational databases.</p>\n\n<p>However, you really have to tweak your objects to get this kind of performance. For example, if you\'ve got a list containing a lot of objects, DB4O activation of these lists is slow. There are a number of ways to get around this problem, for example, by inverting the relationship.</p>\n\n<p>Another pain is activation. When you retrieve or delete an object from DB4O, by default it will activate the whole object tree. For example, loading a Foo will load Foo.Bar.Baz.Bat, etc until there\'s nothing left to load. While this is nice from a programming standpoint, performance will slow down the more nesting in your objects. To improve performance, you can tell DB4O how many levels deep to activate. This is time-consuming to do if you\'ve got a lot of objects.</p>\n\n<p>Another area of pain was text searching. DB4O\'s text searching is far, far slower than SQL full text indexing. (They\'ll tell you this outright on their site.) The good news is, it\'s easy to setup a text searching engine on top of DB4O. On our project, we\'ve hooked up Lucene.NET to index the text fields we want.</p>\n\n<p>Some APIs don\'t seem to work, such as the GetField APIs useful in applying database upgrades. (For example, you\'ve renamed a property and you want to upgrade your existing objects in the database, you need to use these "reflection" APIs to find objects in the database. Other APIs, such as the [Index] attribute don\'t work in the stable 6.4 version, and you must instead specify indexes using the Configure().Index("someField"), which is not strongly typed.</p>\n\n<p>We\'ve witnessed performance degrade the larger your database. We have a 1GB database right now and things are still fast, but not nearly as fast as when we started with a tiny database.</p>\n\n<p>We\'ve found another issue where Db4O.GetByID will close the database if the ID doesn\'t exist anymore in the database.</p>\n\n<p>We\'ve found the Native Query syntax (the most natural, language-integrated syntax for queries) is far, far slower than the less-friendly SODA queries. So instead of typing:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// C# syntax for "Find all MyFoos with Bar == 23".\n// (Note the Java syntax is more verbose using the Predicate class.)\nIList&lt;MyFoo&gt; results = db4o.Query&lt;MyFoo&gt;(input =&gt; input.Bar == 23);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Instead of that nice query code, you have to an ugly SODA query which is string-based and not strongly-typed.</p>\n\n<p>For .NET folks, they\'ve recently introduced a LINQ-to-DB4O provider, which provides for the best syntax yet. However, it\'s yet to be seen whether performance will be up-to-par with the ugly SODA queries.</p>\n\n<p>DB4O support has been decent: we\'ve talked to them on the phone a number of times and have received helpful info. Their user forums are next to worthless, however, almost all questions go unanswered. Their JIRA bug tracker receives a lot of attention, so if you\'ve got a nagging bug, file it on JIRA on it often will get fixed. (We\'ve had 2 bugs that have been fixed, and another one that got patched in a half-assed way.)</p>\n\n<p>If all this hasn\'t scared you off, let me say that we\'re very happy with DB4O, despite the problems we\'ve encountered.

{'answer': "<p>Assuming finalizers are similar to their .NET namesake then you only really need to call these when you have resources such as file handles that can leak. Most of the time your objects don't have these references so they don't need to be called.</p>\n\n<p>It's bad to try to collect the garbage because it's not really your garbage. You have told the VM to allocate some memory when you created objects, and the garbage collector is hiding information about those objects. Internally the GC is performing optimisations on the memory allocations it makes. When you manually try to collect the garbage you have no knowledge about what the GC wants to hold onto and get rid of, you are just forcing it's hand. As a result you mess up internal calculations.</p>\n\n<p>If you knew more about what the GC was holding internally then you might be able to make more informed decisions, but then you've missed the benefits of GC.</p>\n", 'questionId': '28949', 'answerId': '28976'}

{'answer': u'<p>The short answer: Java garbage collection is a very finely tuned tool. System.gc() is a sledge-hammer.</p>\n\n<p>Java\'s heap is divided into different generations, each of which is collected using a different strategy. If you attach a profiler to a healthy app, you\'ll see that it very rarely has to run the most expensive kinds of collections because most objects are caught by the faster copying collector in the young generation.</p>\n\n<p>Calling System.gc() directly, while technically not guaranteed to do anything, in practice will trigger an expensive, stop-the-world full heap collection. This is <em>almost always the wrong thing to do</em>. You think you\'re saving resources, but you\'re actually wasting them for no good reason, forcing Java to recheck all your live objects \u201cjust in case\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>If you are having problems with GC pauses during critical moments, you\'re better off configuring the JVM to use the concurrent mark/sweep collector, which was designed specifically to minimise time spent paused, than trying to take a sledgehammer to the problem and just breaking it further.</p>\n\n<p>The Sun document you were thinking of is here: <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/hotspot/gc/gc_tuning_6.html" rel="noreferrer">Java SE 6 HotSpot&trade; Virtual Machine Garbage Collection Tuning</a></p>\n\n<p>(Another thing you might not know: implementing a finalize() method on your object makes garbage collection slower. Firstly, it will take <em>two</em> GC runs to collect the object: one to run finalize() and the next to ensure that the object wasn\'t resurrected during finalization. Secondly, objects with finalize() methods have to be treated as special cases by the GC because they have to be collected individually, they can\'t just be thrown away in bulk.)</p>\n', 'questionId': '28949', 'answerId': '29038'}

Less path to follow= more explicitly garbage.</p>\n\n<p>Don't forget that (non-static) inner class instances keep references to their parent class instance. So an inner class thread keeps a lot more baggage than you might expect.</p>\n\n<p>In a very related vein, if you're using serialization, and you've serialized temporary objects, you're going to need to clear the serialization caches, by calling ObjectOutputStream.reset()  or your process will leak memory and eventually die.\nDownside is that non-transient objects are going to get re-serialized.\nSerializing temporary result objects can be a bit more messy than you might think!</p>\n\n<p>Consider using soft references.

Either way, it\'s not going to be a little program any more. <strong>edit2:</strong> I could be wrong here, I don\'t know what gets serialized. If it\'s just log4j classes you should be fine.

{'answer': '<p><em>Theoretically</em>, it\'s possible. The Java Serialization, like pretty much everything in Javaland, is standardized. So, you <em>could</em> implement a deserializer according to that standard in Python. However, the Java Serialization format is not designed for cross-language use, the serialization format is closely tied to the way objects are represented inside the JVM. While implementing a JVM in Python is surely a fun exercise, it\'s probably not what you\'re looking for (-:</p>\n\n<p>There are other (data) serialization formats that are specifically designed to be language agnostic. They usually work by stripping the data formats down to the bare minimum (number, string, sequence, dictionary and that\'s it) and thus requiring a bit of work on both ends to represent a rich object as a graph of dumb data structures (and vice versa).</p>\n\n<p>Two examples are <a href="http://JSON.Org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)">JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</a> and <a href="http://YAML.Org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="YAML (YAML Ain&#39;t Markup Language)">YAML (YAML Ain\'t Markup Language)</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://ASN1.Elibel.Tm.Fr/en/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One)">ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One)</a> is another data serialization format. Instead of dumbing the format down to a point where it can be easily understood, ASN.1 is self-describing, meaning all the information needed to decode a stream is encoded within the stream itself.</p>\n\n<p>And, of course, <a href="http://W3.Org/XML/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="XML (eXtensible Markup Language)">XML (eXtensible Markup Language)</a>, will work too, provided that it is not just used to provide textual representation of a "memory dump" of a Java object, but an actual abstract, language-agnostic encoding.</p>\n\n<p>So, to make a long story short: your best bet is to either try to coerce log4j into logging in one of the above-mentioned formats, replace log4j with something that does that or try to somehow intercept the objects before they are sent over the wire and convert them before leaving Javaland.</p>\n\n<p>Libraries that implement JSON, YAML, ASN.1 and XML are available for both Java and Python (and pretty much every programming language known to man).</p>\n', 'questionId': '29505', 'answerId': '29564'}

By doing so you make your application behaviour unpredictable and tied to when the JVM is going to GC your object.

On the other hand, there\'s a good chance it will break in the near future so you could try fixing it in advance.</p>\n\n<p>The two likely reasons it might break are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>SQL injection risk. Depending on where csvDirPath and csvFileName come from (e.g. csvFileName might come from the name of the file uploaded by a user?), and on how clever the Access JDBC driver is, you could be open to someone breaking or deleting your data by inserting a semicolon (or some brackets to make a subquery) and some additional SQL commands into the query.</li>\n<li>You are relying on the columns of the CSV file being compatible with the columns of the Access table. If you have unchecked CSV being uploaded, or if the CSV generator has a particular way of handling nulls, or if you one day get an unusual date or number format, you may get an error on inserting into the Access table.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Having said all that, we are all about pragmatism here. If the above code is from a utility class which you are going to use by hand a few times a week/month/year/ever, then it isn\'t really a problem.</p>\n\n<p>If it is a class which forms part of a web application, then the \'official\' Java way to do it would be to read records out of the CSV file (either using a CSV parser or a CSV/text JDBC driver), get the columns out of the recordset, do some validation or sanity checking on them, and then use a new PreparedStatement to insert them into the Access database. Much more trouble but much more robust.</p>\n\n<p>You can probably find a combination of tools (e.g. object-relational layers or other data access tools) which will do a lot of that for you, but setting up the tools is going to be as much hassle as writing the code.

{'answer': '<p>C++ templates are actually much more powerful than their C# and Java counterparts as they are evaluated at compile time and support specialization. This allows for Template Meta-Programming and makes the C++ compiler equivalent to a Turing machine (i.e. during the compilation process you can compute anything that is computable with a Turing machine).</p>\n', 'questionId': '31693', 'answerId': '31721'}
{'answer': u'<p>C++ rarely uses the \u201cgenerics\u201d terminology. Instead, the word \u201ctemplates\u201d is used and is more accurate. Templates describes one <em>technique</em> to achieve a generic design.</p>\n\n<p>C++ templates is very different from what both C# and Java implement for two main reasons. The first reason is that C++ templates don\'t only allow compile-time type arguments but also compile-time const-value arguments: templates can be given as integers or even function signatures. This means that you can do some quite funky stuff at compile time, e.g. calculations:</p>\n\n<pre><code>template &lt;unsigned int N&gt;\nstruct product {\n    static unsigned int const VALUE = N * product&lt;N - 1&gt;::VALUE;\n};\n\ntemplate &lt;&gt;\nstruct product&lt;1&gt; {\n    static unsigned int const VALUE = 1;\n};\n\n// Usage:\nunsigned int const p5 = product&lt;5&gt;::VALUE;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This code also uses the other distinguished feature of C++ templates, namely template specialization. The code defines one class template, <code>product</code> that has one value argument. It also defines a specialization for that template that is used whenever the argument evaluates to 1. This allows me to define a recursion over template definitions. I believe that this was first discovered by <a href="http://erdani.org/" rel="noreferrer">Andrei Alexandrescu</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Template specialization is important for C++ because it allows for structural differences in data structures. Templates as a whole is a means of unifying an interface across types. However, although this is desirable, all types cannot be treated equally inside the implementation. C++ templates takes this into account. This is very much the same difference that OOP makes between interface and implementation with the overriding of virtual methods.</p>\n\n<p>C++ templates are essential for its algorithmic programming paradigm. For example, almost all algorithms for containers are defined as functions that accept the container type as a template type and treat them uniformly. Actually, that\'s not quite right: C++ doesn\'t work on containers but rather on <em>ranges</em> that are defined by two iterators, pointing to the beginning and behind the end of the container. Thus, the whole content is circumscribed by the iterators: begin &lt;= elements &lt; end.</p>\n\n<p>Using iterators instead of containers is useful because it allows to operate on parts of a container instead of on the whole.</p>\n\n<p>Another distinguishing feature of C++ is the possibility of <em>partial specialization</em> for class templates. This is somewhat related to pattern matching on arguments in Haskell and other functional languages. For example, let\'s consider a class that stores elements:</p>\n\n<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;\nclass Store { \u2026 }; // (1)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works for any element type. But let\'s say that we can store pointers more effciently than other types by applying some special trick. We can do this by <em>partially</em> specializing for all pointer types:</p>\n\n<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;\nclass Store&lt;T*&gt; { \u2026 }; // (2)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, whenever we instance a container template for one type, the appropriate definition is used:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Store&lt;int&gt; x; // Uses (1)\nStore&lt;int*&gt; y; // Uses (2)\nStore&lt;string**&gt; z; // Uses (2), with T = string*.\n</code></pre>\n', 'questionId': '31693', 'answerId': '31758'}

{'answer': "<p>Follow-up to my previous posting.</p>\n\n<p>Templates are one of the main reasons why C++ fails so abysmally at intellisense, regardless of the IDE used. Because of template specialization, the IDE can never be really sure if a given member exists or not. Consider:</p>\n\n<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;\nstruct X {\n    void foo() { }\n};\n\ntemplate &lt;&gt;\nstruct X&lt;int&gt; { };\n\ntypedef int my_int_type;\n\nX&lt;my_int_type&gt; a;\na.|\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, the cursor is at the indicated position and it's damn hard for the IDE to say at that point if, and what, members <code>a</code> has. For other languages the parsing would be straightforward but for C++, quite a bit of evaluation is needed beforehand.</p>\n\n<p>It gets worse. What if <code>my_int_type</code> were defined inside a class template as well? Now its type would depend on another type argument. And here, even compilers fail.</p>\n\n<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;\nstruct Y {\n    typedef T my_type;\n};\n\nX&lt;Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type&gt; b;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After a bit of thinking, a programmer would conclude that this code is the same as the above: <code>Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type</code> resolves to <code>int</code>, therefore <code>b</code> should be the same type as <code>a</code>, right?</p>\n\n<p>Wrong. At the point where the compiler tries to resolve this statement, it doesn't actually know <code>Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type</code> yet! Therefore, it doesn't know that this is a type. It could be something else, e.g. a member function or a field. This might give rise to ambiguities (though not in the present case), therefore the compiler fails. We have to tell it explicitly that we refer to a type name:</p>\n\n<pre><code>X&lt;typename Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type&gt; b;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, the code compiles. To see how ambiguities arise from this situation, consider the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type(123);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This code statement is perfectly valid and tells C++ to execute the function call to <code>Y&lt;int&gt;::my_type</code>. However, if <code>my_type</code> is not a function but rather a type, this statement would still be valid and perform a special cast (the function-style cast) which is often a constructor invocation.

{'answer': '<p>Both Java and C# introduced generics after their first language release.

{'answer': '<p>I\'ll add my voice to the noise and take a stab at making things clear:</p>\n\n<h2>C# Generics allow you to declare something like this.</h2>\n\n<pre><code>List&lt;Person&gt; foo = new List&lt;Person&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then the compiler will prevent you from putting things that aren\'t <code>Person</code> into the list.<br>\nBehind the scenes the C# compiler is just putting <code>List&lt;Person&gt;</code> into the .NET dll file, but at runtime the JIT compiler  goes and builds a new set of code, as if you had written a special list class just for containing people - something like <code>ListOfPerson</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The benefit of this is that it makes it really fast. There\'s no casting or any other stuff, and because the dll contains the information that this is a List of <code>Person</code>, other code that looks at it later on using reflection can tell that it contains <code>Person</code> objects (so you get intellisense and so on).</p>\n\n<p>The downside of this is that old C# 1.0 and 1.1 code (before they added generics) doesn\'t understand these new <code>List&lt;something&gt;</code>, so you have to manually convert things back to plain old <code>List</code> to interoperate with them. This is not that big of a problem, because C# 2.0 binary code is not backwards compatible. The only time this will ever happen is if you\'re upgrading some old C# 1.0/1.1 code to C# 2.0</p>\n\n<h2>Java Generics allow you to declare something like this.</h2>\n\n<pre><code>ArrayList&lt;Person&gt; foo = new ArrayList&lt;Person&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>On the surface it looks the same, and it sort-of is. The compiler will also prevent you from putting things that aren\'t <code>Person</code> into the list.</p>\n\n<p>The difference is what happens behind the scenes. Unlike C#, Java does not go and build a special <code>ListOfPerson</code> - it just uses the plain old <code>ArrayList</code> which has always been in Java. When you get things out of the array, the usual <code>Person p = (Person)foo.get(1);</code> casting-dance still has to be done. The compiler is saving you the key-presses, but the speed hit/casting is still incurred just like it always was.<br>\nWhen people mention "Type Erasure" this is what they\'re talking about. The compiler inserts the casts for you, and then \'erases\' the fact that it\'s meant to be a list of <code>Person</code> not just <code>Object</code></p>\n\n<p>The benefit of this approach is that old code which doesn\'t understand generics doesn\'t have to care. It\'s still dealing with the same old <code>ArrayList</code> as it always has. This is more important in the java world because they wanted to support compiling code using Java 5 with generics, and having it run on old 1.4 or previous JVM\'s, which microsoft deliberately decided not to bother with.</p>\n\n<p>The downside is the speed hit I mentioned previously, and also because there is no <code>ListOfPerson</code> pseudo-class or anything like that going into the .class files, code that looks at it later on (with reflection, or if you pull it out of another collection where it\'s been converted into <code>Object</code> or so on) can\'t tell in any way that it\'s meant to be a list containing only <code>Person</code> and not just any other array list.</p>\n\n<h2>C++ Templates allow you to declare something like this</h2>\n\n<pre><code>std::list&lt;Person&gt;* foo = new std::list&lt;Person&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It looks like C# and Java generics, and it will do what you think it should do, but behind the scenes different things are happening.</p>\n\n<p>It has the most in common with C# generics in that it builds special <code>pseudo-classes</code> rather than just throwing the type information away like java does, but it\'s a whole different kettle of fish.</p>\n\n<p>Both C# and Java produce output which is designed for virtual machines. If you write some code which has a <code>Person</code> class in it, in both cases some information about a <code>Person</code> class will go into the .dll or .class file, and the JVM/CLR will do stuff with this.</p>\n\n<p>C++ produces raw x86 binary code. Everything is <em>not</em> an object, and there\'s no underlying virtual machine which needs to know about a <code>Person</code> class. There\'s no boxing or unboxing, and functions don\'t have to belong to classes, or indeed anything. </p>\n\n<p>Because of this, the C++ compiler places no restrictions on what you can do with templates - basically any code you could write manually, you can get templates to write for you.<br>\nThe most obvious example is adding things:</p>\n\n<p>In C# and Java, the generics system needs to know what methods are available for a class, and it needs to pass this down to the virtual machine. The only way to tell it this is by either hard-coding the actual class in, or using interfaces. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>string addNames&lt;T&gt;( T first, T second ) { return first.Name() + second.Name(); }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That code won\'t compile in C# or Java, because it doesn\'t know that the type <code>T</code> actually provides a method called Name(). You have to tell it - in C# like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>interface IHasName{ string Name(); };\nstring addNames&lt;T&gt;( T first, T second ) where T : IHasName { .... }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then you have to make sure the things you pass to addNames implement the IHasName interface and so on. The java syntax is different (<code>&lt;T extends IHasName&gt;</code>), but it suffers from the same problems.</p>\n\n<p>The \'classic\' case for this problem is trying to write a function which does this</p>\n\n<pre><code>string addNames&lt;T&gt;( T first, T second ) { return first + second; }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can\'t actually write this code because there are no ways to declare an interface with the <code>+</code> method in it. You fail.</p>\n\n<p>C++ suffers from none of these problems. The compiler doesn\'t care about passing types down to any VM\'s - if both your objects have a .Name() function, it will compile. If they don\'t, it won\'t. Simple.</p>\n\n<p>So, there you have it :-)</p>\n', 'questionId': '31693', 'answerId': '31929'}

On a Windows system, you can set up ODBC datasources for delimited text files, Excel files, etc. Then you can set up the JdbcOdbcDriver in your Java application to use this data source.</p>\n\n<p>For most of the applications I work on, I would not consider this approach; I would use an import/export mechanism to convert from a real database (even if it's an in-process database like Berkeley DB or Derby) to the text files. Yes, it's an extra step, but it could be automated, and the performance isn't likely to be much worse than trying to use the text files directly (it will likely be much better, overall), and it will be more robust and easy to develop.</p>\n", 'questionId': '33438', 'answerId': '33516'}

The project as a whole needs to decide on an assertion policy: if the choice is to enable assertions during all development, then I'd say to use assertions to check this kind of invalid parameter - in a production system, a NullPointerException thrown due to a programming error is unlikely to be able to be caught and handled in a meaningful way anyway and so will act just like an assertion.</p>\n\n<p>Practically though, I know a lot of developers that don't trust that assertions will be enabled when appropriate and so opt for the safety of throwing a NullPointerException.</p>\n\n<p>Of course if you can't enforce a policy for your code (if you're creating a library, for example, and so are dependent on how other developers run your code), you should opt for the safe approach of throwing NullPointerException for those methods that are part of the library's API.</p>\n", 'questionId': '32280', 'answerId': '33552'}
{'answer': '<p>IMO, wrapping exceptions (checked or otherwise) has several benefits that are worth the cost:</p>\n\n<p>1) It encourages you to think about the failure modes for the code you write. Basically, you have to consider the exceptions that the code you call may throw, and in turn you\'ll consider the exceptions you\'ll throw for the code that calls yours.</p>\n\n<p>2) It gives you the opportunity to add additional debugging information into the exception chain. For instance, if you have a method that throws an exception on a duplicate username, you might wrap that exception with one that includes additional information about the circumstances of the failure (for example, the IP of the request that provided the dupe username) that wasn\'t available to the lower-level code. The cookie trail of exceptions may help you debug a complex problem (it certainly has for me).</p>\n\n<p>3) It lets you become implementation-independent from the lower level code. If you\'re wrapping exceptions and need to swap out Hibernate for some other ORM, you only have to change your Hibernate-handling code. All the other layers of code will still be successfully using the wrapped exceptions and will interpret them in the same way, even though the underlying circumstances have changed. Note that this applies even if Hibernate changes in some way (ex: they switch exceptions in a new version); it\'s not just for wholesale technology replacement.</p>\n\n<p>4) It encourages you use different classes of exceptions to represent different situations. For example, you may have a DuplicateUsernameException when the user tries to reuse a username, and a DatabaseFailureException when you can\'t check for dupe usernames due to a broken DB connection. This, in turn, lets you answer your question ("how do I recover?") in flexible and powerful ways. If you get a DuplicateUsernameException, you may decide to suggest a different username to the user. If you get a DatabaseFailureException, you may let it bubble up to the point where it displays a "down for maintenance" page to the user and send off a notification email to you. Once you have custom exceptions, you have customizeable responses -- and that\'s a good thing.</p>\n', 'questionId': '33497', 'answerId': '33564'}

{'answer': '<p>There are already a lot of good answers on <em>what</em> the differences are, so let me give a slightly different perspective and add the <em>why</em>.</p>\n\n<p>As was already explained, the main difference is <em>type erasure</em>, i.e. the fact that the Java compiler erases the generic types and they don\'t end up in the generated bytecode. However, the question is: why would anyone do that? It doesn\'t make sense! Or does it?</p>\n\n<p>Well, what\'s the alternative? If you don\'t implement generics in the language, where <em>do</em> you implement them? And the answer is: in the Virtual Machine. Which breaks backwards compatibility.</p>\n\n<p>Type erasure, on the other hand, allows you to mix generic clients with non-generic libraries. In other words: code that was compiled on Java 5 can still be deployed to Java 1.4.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft, however, decided to break backwards compatibility for generics. <em>That\'s</em> why .NET Generics are "better" than Java Generics.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, Sun aren\'t idiots or cowards. The reason why they "chickened out", was that Java was significantly older and more widespread than .NET when they introduced generics. (They were introduced roughly at the same time in both worlds.) Breaking backwards compatibility would have been a huge pain.</p>\n\n<p>Put yet another way: in Java, Generics are a part of the <em>Language</em> (which means they apply <em>only</em> to Java, not to other languages), in .NET they are part of the <em>Virtual Machine</em> (which means they apply to <em>all</em> languages, not just C# and Visual Basic.NET).</p>\n\n<p>Compare this with .NET features like LINQ, lambda expressions, local variable type inference, anonymous types and expression trees: these are all <em>language</em> features. That\'s why there are subtle differences between VB.NET and C#: if those features were part of the VM, they would be the same in <em>all</em> languages. But the CLR hasn\'t changed: it\'s still the same in .NET 3.5 SP1 as it was in .NET 2.0. You can compile a C# program that uses LINQ with the .NET 3.5 compiler and still run it on .NET 2.0, provided that you don\'t use any .NET 3.5 libraries. That would <em>not</em> work with generics and .NET 1.1, but it <em>would</em> work with Java and Java 1.4.</p>\n', 'questionId': '31693', 'answerId': '33729'}

Button event listeners and so on will be invoked here (as will navigation if memory serves).</li>\n<li><strong>Render Response</strong>. The tree is rendered via the renderers and the state saved.</li>\n<li>If any of these phases fail (e.g. a value is invalid), the lifecycle skips to Render Response.</li>\n<li>Various events can be fired after most of these phases, invoking listeners as appropriate (like value change listeners after Process Validations).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is a somewhat simplified version of events.

The following patterns will let you do pretty much anything related to the private methods and fields.

In short: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The notify() method is generally used\n  for <strong>resource pools</strong>, where there\n  are an arbitrary number of "consumers"\n  or "workers" that take resources, but\n  when a resource is added to the pool,\n  only one of the waiting consumers or\n  workers can deal with it. The\n  notifyAll() method is actually used in\n  most other cases. Strictly, it is\n  required to notify waiters of a\n  condition that could allow multiple\n  waiters to proceed. But this is often\n  difficult to know. So as a general\n  rule, <strong>if you have no particular\n  logic for using notify(), then you\n  should probably use notifyAll()</strong>,\n  because it is often difficult to know\n  exactly what threads will be waiting\n  on a particular object and why.</p>\n</blockquote>\n', 'questionId': '37026', 'answerId': '37045'}

Do you want to tell one of the waiting threads that something happened, or do you want to tell all of them at the same time?</p>\n\n<p>In some cases, all waiting threads can take useful action once the wait finishes. An example would be a set of threads waiting for a certain task to finish; once the task has finished, all waiting threads can continue with their business. In such a case you would use <b>notifyAll()</b> to wake up all waiting threads at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>Another case, for example mutually exclusive locking, only one of the waiting threads can do something useful after being notified (in this case acquire the lock). In such a case, you would rather use <b>notify()</b>.

{'answer': '<p>Ultimately you always have a finite max of heap to use no matter what platform you are running on. In Windows 32 bit this is around 2gb (not specifically heap but total amount of memory per process). It just happens that Java chooses to make the default smaller (presumably so that the programmer can\'t create programs that have runaway memory allocation without running into this problem and having to examine exactly what they are doing).</p>\n\n<p>So this given there are several approaches you could take to either determine what amount of memory you need or to reduce the amount of memory you are using. One common mistake with garbage collected languages such as Java or C# is to keep around references to objects that you no longer are using, or allocating many objects when you could reuse them instead. As long as objects have a reference to them they will continue to use heap space as the garbage collector will not delete them.</p>\n\n<p>In this case you can use a Java memory profiler to determine what methods in your program are allocating large number of objects and then determine if there is a way to make sure they are no longer referenced, or to not allocate them in the first place. One option which I have used in the past is "JMP" <a href="http://www.khelekore.org/jmp/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.khelekore.org/jmp/</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If you determine that you are allocating these objects for a reason and you need to keep around references (depending on what you are doing this might be the case), you will just need to increase the max heap size when you start the program. However, once you do the memory profiling and understand how your objects are getting allocated you should have a better idea about how much memory you need. </p>\n\n<p>In general if you can\'t guarantee that your program will run in some finite amount of memory (perhaps depending on input size) you will always run into this problem. Only after exhausting all of this will you need to look into caching objects out to disk etc. At this point you should have a very good reason to say "I need Xgb of memory" for something and you can\'t work around it by improving your algorithms or memory allocation patterns. Generally this will only usually be the case for algorithms operating on large datasets (like a database or some scientific analysis program) and then techniques like caching and memory mapped IO become useful.</p>\n', 'questionId': '37335', 'answerId': '37349'}

As soon as you get the input stream the output stream is closed and it waits for the response from the server.</p>\n\n<p>For example, this should do a POST:</p>\n\n<pre><code>URL myURL = new URL("http://example.com/my/path");\nURLConnection conn = myURL.openConnection();\nconn.setDoOutput(true);\nconn.setDoInput(true);\n\nOutputStream os = conn.getOutputStream();\nos.write("Hi there!");\nos.close();\n\nInputStream is = conn.getInputStream();\n// read stuff here\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>While this would do a GET:</p>\n\n<pre><code>URL myURL = new URL("http://example.com/my/path");\nURLConnection conn = myURL.openConnection();\nconn.setDoOutput(false);\nconn.setDoInput(true);\n\nInputStream is = conn.getInputStream();\n// read stuff here\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>URLConnection</code> will also do other weird things.  If the server specifies a content length then <code>URLConnection</code> will keep the underlying input stream open until it receives that much data, <em>even if you explicitly close it</em>.  This caused a lot of problems for us as it made shutting our client down cleanly a bit hard, as the <code>URLConnection</code> would keep the network connection open.  This probably probably exists even if you just use <code>getStream()</code> though.</p>\n', 'questionId': '39391', 'answerId': '39449'}

My opinion of Tapestry has changed over the years; I have modified this post to reflect it.</p>\n\n<p>I can no longer recommend Tapestry as I did previously. Tapestry 5 appears to be a significant improvement, but my main issue with Tapestry is not with platform itself; it\'s with the people behind it.</p>\n\n<p>Historically, every major version update of Tapestry has broken backwards compatibility with extreme prejudice, far more than one might expect. This seems to be due to the incorporation of new coding techniques or technologies that require significant rewrites.</p>\n\n<p>Howard Lewis Ship (the principal author of Tapestry) is certainly a brilliant developer, but I can\'t say I care for his management of the Tapestry project. Development of Tapestry 5 began almost immediately after Tapestry 4 shipped. From what I can tell, Ship pretty much devoted himself to that, leaving Tapestry 4 in the hands of other contributors, who I feel are not nearly as capable as Ship. After having made the painful switch from Tapestry 3 to Tapestry 4, I felt that I had been abandoned almost immediately.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, with the release of Tapestry 5, Tapestry 4 became a legacy product. I wouldn\'t have a problem with this if the upgrade path wasn\'t so brutal <strong>again</strong>. So now our development team is in the rather unenviable position: We could continue to use an essentially abandoned web platform (Tapestry 4), make the heinous upgrade to Tapestry 5, or give up on Tapestry entirely and rewrite our application using another platform. None of these options is very attractive.</p>\n\n<p>Tapestry 5 is supposedly written so as to reduce the likelihood of update breakage from this point forward. A good example is in the page classes: in previous incarnations, page classes descended from a base class provided by Tapestry; incompatible API changes in this class were the cause of a large number of backward compatibility problems. In Tapestry 5, pages are POJOs which are enhanced at runtime with the "magic Tapestry fairy dust" via annotations. So as long as the contract for the annotations is maintained, changes to Tapestry won\'t affect your page classes.</p>\n\n<p>If this is right, then writing a new application using Tapestry 5 could turn out well.

This shows you what objects are using the most memory. But the objects aren\'t lumped together solely by type: each entry also includes a "trace" ID. You can then search for that "TRACE nnnn" to see the top few frames of the stack where the object was allocated. Often, once I see where the object is allocated, I find a bug and I\'m done. Also, note that you can control how many frames are recorded in the stack with the options to -Xrunhprof.</p>\n\n<p>If you check out the allocation site, and don\'t see anything wrong, you have to start backward chaining from some of those live objects to root objects, to find the unexpected reference chain. This is where a tool really helps, but you can do the same thing by hand (well, with grep). There is not just one root object (i.e., object not subject to garbage collection). Threads, classes, and stack frames act as root objects, and anything they reference strongly is not collectible.</p>\n\n<p>To do the chaining, look in the HEAP DUMP section for entries with the bad trace id. This will take you to an OBJ or ARR entry, which shows a unique object identifier in hexadecimal. Search for all occurrences of that id to find who\'s got a strong reference to the object.

{'answer': '<p>Java is always <strong>pass-by-value</strong>. Unfortunately, they decided to call the location of an object a "reference".  When we pass the value of an object, we are passing the <em>reference</em> to it.

If it were passed by reference, then the <code>aDog.getName()</code> in <code>main</code> would return <code>"Fifi"</code> after the call to <code>foo</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static void main( String[] args ) {\n    Dog aDog = new Dog("Max");\n    foo(aDog);\n    // when foo(...) returns, the name of the dog has been changed to "Fifi"\n    aDog.getName().equals("Fifi"); // true\n}\n\npublic static void foo(Dog d) {\n    d.getName().equals("Max"); // true\n    // this changes the name of d to be "Fifi"\n    d.setName("Fifi");\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above example, <code>FiFi</code> is the dog\'s name after call to <code>foo(aDog)</code> because the object\'s name was set inside of <code>foo(...)</code>.

{'answer': '<p>To make a long story short, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29" rel="noreferrer">Java</a> objects have some very peculiar properties.</p>\n\n<p>In general, Java has primitive types (<code>int</code>, <code>bool</code>, <code>char</code>, <code>double</code>, etc) that are passed directly by value. Then Java has objects (everything that derives from <code>java.lang.Object</code>). Objects are actually always handled through a reference (a reference being a pointer that you can\'t touch). That means that in effect, objects are passed by reference, as the references are normally not interesting. It does however mean that you cannot change which object is pointed to as the reference itself is passed by value.</p>\n\n<p>Does this sound strange and confusing? Let\'s consider how C implements pass by reference and pass by value. In C, the default convention is pass by value. <code>void foo(int x)</code> passes an int by value. <code>void foo(int *x)</code> is a function that does not want an <code>int a</code>, but a pointer to an int: <code>foo(&amp;a)</code>. One would use this with the <code>&amp;</code> operator to pass a variable address.</p>\n\n<p>Take this to C++, and we have references. References are basically (in this context) syntactic sugar that hide the pointer part of the equation: <code>void foo(int &amp;x)</code> is called by <code>foo(a)</code>, where the compiler itself knows that it is a reference and the address of the non-reference <code>a</code> should be passed. In Java, all variables referring to objects are actually of reference type, in effect forcing call by reference for most intends and purposes without the fine grained control (and complexity) afforded by, for example, C++.</p>\n', 'questionId': '40480', 'answerId': '40630'}

There should be a separate authorization system that protects objects whose identifier can be guessed by an attacker without access permission.</p>\n\n<p>Care must be also be taken to use identifiers that are long enough to make collisions unlikely given the anticipated total number of identifiers. This is referred to as "the birthday paradox." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem#Square_approximation" rel="noreferrer">The probability of a collision,</a> <em>p</em>, is approximately n<sup>2</sup>/(2q<sup>x</sup>), where <em>n</em> is the number of identifiers actually generated, <em>q</em> is the number of distinct symbols in the alphabet, and <em>x</em> is the length of the identifiers. This should be a very small number, like 2<sup>&#8209;50</sup> or less.</p>\n\n<p>Working this out shows that the chance of collision among 500k 15-character identifiers is about 2<sup>&#8209;52</sup>, which is probably less likely than undetected errors from cosmic rays, etc.</p>\n\n<h2>Comparison with UUIDs</h2>\n\n<p>According to their specification, UUIDs are not designed to be unpredictable, and <em>should not</em> be used as session identifiers.</p>\n\n<p>UUIDs in their standard format take a lot of space: 36 characters for only 122 bits of entropy. (Not all bits of a "random" UUID are selected randomly.) A randomly chosen alphanumeric string packs more entropy in just 21 characters.</p>\n\n<p>UUIDs are not flexible; they have a standardized structure and layout. This is their chief virtue as well as their main weakness. When collaborating with an outside party, the standardization offered by UUIDs may be helpful.

It is true that the values read by Thread1 will be (a few microseconds) out of date, but it won\'t crash on an IndexOutOfBounds or NullPointer exception or something like it would if it was reading a mutable object that was being written to.

This construct, and the new keywords <code>delegate</code> and\n  <code>multicast</code> introduced to support it, are not a part of the Java<sup>TM</sup>\n  programming language, which is specified by the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110628230222/http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/j.title.doc.html" rel="noreferrer">Java Language\n  Specification</a> and amended by the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110628230222/http://java.sun.com/products/archive/jdk/1.1/index.html" rel="noreferrer">Inner Classes Specification</a> included\n  in the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110628230222/http://java.sun.com/products/archive/jdk/1.1/index.html" rel="noreferrer">documentation for the JDKTM 1.1 software</a>. </p>\n  \n  <p>It is unlikely that the Java programming language will ever include\n  this construct. Sun already carefully considered adopting it in 1996,\n  to the extent of building and discarding working prototypes. Our\n  conclusion was that bound method references are unnecessary and\n  detrimental to the language. This decision was made in consultation\n  with Borland International, who had previous experience with bound\n  method references in Delphi Object Pascal. </p>\n  \n  <p>We believe bound method references are <em>unnecessary</em> because another\n  design alternative, <em>inner classes</em>, provides equal or superior\n  functionality. In particular, inner classes fully support the\n  requirements of user-interface event handling, and have been used to\n  implement a user-interface API at least as comprehensive as the\n  Windows Foundation Classes. </p>\n  \n  <p>We believe bound method references are <em>harmful</em> because they detract\n  from the simplicity of the Java programming language and the\n  pervasively object-oriented character of the APIs. Bound method\n  references also introduce irregularity into the language syntax and\n  scoping rules. Finally, they dilute the investment in VM technologies\n  because VMs are required to handle additional and disparate types of\n  references and method linkage efficiently.</p>\n</blockquote>\n', 'questionId': '44912', 'answerId': '44916'}

{'answer': '<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/47615/662581">Niyaz</a> is correct, but it\'s also worth noting that the special + operator can be converted into something more efficient by the Java compiler.

When performing a bunch of String concatenations, the Java compiler silently converts</p>\n\n<pre><code>String a = b + c + d;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>into</p>\n\n<pre><code>String a = new StringBuilder(b).append(c).append(d).toString();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which for large strings is significantly more efficient.  As far as I know, this does not happen when you use the concat method.</p>\n\n<p>However, the concat method is more efficient when concatenating an empty String onto an existing String.  In this case, the JVM does not need to create a new String object and can simply return the existing one.  See <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#concat(java.lang.String)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the concat documentation</a> to confirm this.</p>\n\n<p>So if you\'re super-concerned about efficiency then you should use the concat method when concatenating possibly-empty Strings, and use + otherwise.

{'answer': '<p>No, not quite.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, there\'s a slight difference in semantics. If <code>a</code> is <code>null</code>, then <code>a.concat(b)</code> throws a <code>NullPointerException</code> but <code>a+=b</code> will treat the original value of <code>a</code> as if it were <code>null</code>. Furthermore, the <code>concat()</code> method only accepts <code>String</code> values while the <code>+</code> operator will silently convert the argument to a String (using the <code>toString()</code> method for objects). So the <code>concat()</code> method is more strict in what it accepts.</p>\n\n<p>To look under the hood, write a simple class with <code>a += b;</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Concat {\n    String cat(String a, String b) {\n        a += b;\n        return a;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now disassemble with <code>javap -c</code> (included in the Sun JDK). You should see a listing including:</p>\n\n<pre><code>java.lang.String cat(java.lang.String, java.lang.String);\n  Code:\n   0:   new     #2; //class java/lang/StringBuilder\n   3:   dup\n   4:   invokespecial   #3; //Method java/lang/StringBuilder."&lt;init&gt;":()V\n   7:   aload_1\n   8:   invokevirtual   #4; //Method java/lang/StringBuilder.append:(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;\n   11:  aload_2\n   12:  invokevirtual   #4; //Method java/lang/StringBuilder.append:(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;\n   15:  invokevirtual   #5; //Method java/lang/StringBuilder.toString:()Ljava/lang/    String;\n   18:  astore_1\n   19:  aload_1\n   20:  areturn\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, <code>a += b</code> is the equivalent of</p>\n\n<pre><code>a = new StringBuilder()\n    .append(a)\n    .append(b)\n    .toString();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>concat</code> method should be faster. However, with more strings the <code>StringBuilder</code> method wins, at least in terms of performance.</p>\n\n<p>The source code of <code>String</code> and <code>StringBuilder</code> (and its package-private base class) is available in src.zip of the Sun JDK. You can see that you are building up a char array (resizing as necessary) and then throwing it away when you create the final <code>String</code>.

{'answer': '<p>You should be using <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> (IAE), not <code>NullPointerException</code> (NPE) for the following reasons:</p>\n\n<p>First, the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html" rel="noreferrer">NPE JavaDoc</a> explicitly lists the cases where NPE is appropriate.  Notice that all of them are thrown <em>by the runtime</em> when <code>null</code> is used inappropriately.  In contrast, the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/IllegalArgumentException.html" rel="noreferrer">IAE JavaDoc</a> couldn\'t be more clear: "Thrown to indicate that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument."  Yup, that\'s you!</p>\n\n<p>Second, when you see an NPE in a stack trace, what do you assume?  Probably that someone dereferenced a <code>null</code>.  When you see IAE, you assume the caller of the method at the top of the stack passed in an illegal value.  Again, the latter assumption is true, the former is misleading.</p>\n\n<p>Third, since IAE is clearly designed for validating parameters, you have to assume it as the default choice of exception, so why would you choose NPE instead?  Certainly not for different behavior -- do you really expect calling code to catch NPE\'s separately from IAE and do something different as a result?  Are you trying to communicate a more specific error message?  But you can do that in the exception message text anyway, as you should for all other incorrect parameters.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, all other incorrect parameter data will be IAE, so why not be consistent?  Why is it that an illegal <code>null</code> is so special that it deserves a separate exception from all other types of illegal arguments?</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I accept the argument given by other answers that parts of the Java API use NPE in this manner.  However, the Java API is inconsistent with everything from exception types to naming conventions, so I think just blindly copying (your favorite part of) the Java API isn\'t a good enough argument to trump these other considerations.</p>\n', 'questionId': '3881', 'answerId': '47710'}

It verifies that data is\n  used consistently: code that\n  manipulates a data item as an integer\n  at one stage and then tries to use it\n  as a pointer later will be caught and\n  prevented from executing. (The Java\n  language doesn\'t allow pointer\n  arithmetic, so you can\'t write Java\n  code to do what we just described.\n  However, there is nothing to prevent\n  someone from writing destructive byte\n  code themselves using a hexadecimal\n  editor or even building a Java byte\n  code assembler.) It generally isn\'t\n  possible to analyze a program\'s\n  machine code before execution and\n  determine whether it does anything\n  bad. Tricks like writing\n  self-modifying code mean that the evil\n  operations may not even exist until\n  later. But Java byte code was designed\n  for this kind of validation: it\n  doesn\'t have the instructions a\n  malicious programmer would use to hide\n  their assault.</p></li>\n  <li><p><strong>Size</strong>: In the microprocessor world RISC is generally preferable\n  over CISC. It\'s better to have a small\n  instruction set and use many fast\n  instructions to do a job than to have\n  many complex operations implemented as\n  single instructions. RISC designs\n  require fewer gates on the chip to\n  implement their instructions, allowing\n  for more room for pipelines and other\n  techniques to make each instruction\n  faster. In an interpreter, however,\n  none of this matters. If you want to\n  implement a single instruction for the\n  switch statement with a variable\n  length depending on the number of case\n  clauses, there\'s no reason not to do\n  so. In fact, a complex instruction set\n  is an advantage for a web-based\n  language: it means that the same\n  program will be smaller (fewer\n  instructions of greater complexity),\n  which means less time to transfer\n  across our speed-limited network.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So when considering byte code vs native, consider which trade-offs you want to make between portability, security, size, and execution speed. If speed is the only important factor, go native. If any of the others are more important, go with bytecode.</p>\n\n<p>I\'ll also add that maintaining a series of OS and architecture-targeted compilations of the same code base for every release can become very tedious.

{'answer': "<p>Ideally you would have portable bytecode that compiles Just In Time to native code.

{'answer': '<p>Jeff\'s mechanism was to create some sort of cached object which ASP.Net would automatically recreate at some sort of interval - It seemed to be an ASP.Net specific solution, so probably won\'t help you (or me) much in Java world.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href="https://stackoverflow.fogbugz.com/default.asp?W13117" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://stackoverflow.fogbugz.com/default.asp?W13117</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Atwood: Well, I originally asked on Twitter, because I just wanted something light weight.  I really didn\'t want to like write a windows service.  I felt like that was out of band code. Plus the code that actually does the work is a web page in fact, because to me that is a logical unit of work on a website is a web page.  So, it really is like we are calling back into the web site, it\'s just like another request in the website, so I viewed it as something that should stay inline, and the little approach that we came up that was recommended to me on Twitter was to essentially to add something to the application cache with a fixed expiration, then you have a call back so when that expires it calls a certain function which does the work then you add it back in to the cache with the same expiration.  So, it\'s a little bit, maybe "ghetto" is the right word.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My approach has always been to have to OS (i.e. Cron or the Windows task scheduler) load a specific URL at some interval, and then setup a page at that URL to check it\'s queue, and perform whatever tasks were required, but I\'d be interested to hear if there\'s a better way.</p>\n\n<p>From the transcript, it looks like FogBugz uses the windows service loading a URL approach also.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Spolsky: So we have this special page called heartbeat.asp.  And that page, whenever you hit it, and anybody can hit it at anytime: doesn\'t hurt.  But when that page runs it checks a queue of waiting tasks to see if there\'s anything that needs to be done.  And if there\'s anything that needs to be done, it does one thing and then looks in that queue again and if there\'s anything else to be done it returns a plus, and the entire web page that it returns is just a single character with a plus in it.  And if there\'s nothing else to be done, the queue is now empty, it returns a minus.  So, anybody can call this and hit it as many times, you can load up heartbeat.asp in your web browser you hit Ctrl-R Ctrl-R Ctrl-R Ctrl-R until you start getting minuses instead of pluses.  And when you\'ve done that FogBugz will have completed all of its maintenance work that it needs to do.  So that\'s the first part, and the second part is a very, very simple Windows service which runs, and its whole job is to call heartbeat.asp and if it gets a plus, call it again soon, and if it gets a minus call it again, but not for a while.  So basically there\'s this Windows service that\'s always running, that has a very, very, very simple task of just hitting a URL, and looking to see if it gets a plus or a minus and, and then scheduling when it runs again based on whether it got a plus or a minus.  And obviously you can do any kind of variation you want on this theme, like for example, uh you could actually, instead of returning just a plus or minus you could say "Okay call me back in 60 seconds" or "Call me back right away I have more work to be done."  And that\'s how it works... so that maintenance service it just runs, you know, it\'s like, you know, a half page of code that runs that maintenance service, and it never has to change, and it doesn\'t have any of the logic in there, it just contains the tickling that causes these web pages to get called with a certain guaranteed frequency.  And inside that web page at heartbeat.asp there\'s code that maintains a queue of tasks that need to be done and looks at how much time has elapsed and does, you know, late-night maintenance and every seven days delete all the older messages that have been marked as spam and all kinds of just maintenance background tasks.

I often find myself filtering/mapping lists, and being able to say <code>[line.replace("spam","eggs") for line in open("somefile.txt") if line.startswith("nee")]</code> is really nice.</p></li>\n<li><p>Functions are first class objects.  They can be passed as parameters to other functions, defined inside other function, and have lexical scope.  This makes it really easy to say things like <code>people.sort(key=lambda p: p.age)</code> and thus sort a bunch of people on their age without having to define a custom comparator class or something equally verbose.</p></li>\n<li><p>Everything is an object.  Java has basic types which aren\'t objects, which is why many classes in the standard library define 9 different versions of functions (for boolean, byte, char, double, float, int, long, Object, short).  <code>Array.sort</code> is a good example.  Autoboxing helps, although it makes things awkward when something turns out to be null.</p></li>\n<li><p>Properties.  Python lets you create classes with read-only fields, lazily-generated fields, as well as fields which are checked upon assignment to make sure they\'re never 0 or null or whatever you want to guard against, etc.\'</p></li>\n<li><p>Default and keyword arguments.  In Java if you want a constructor that can take up to 5 optional arguments, you must define 6 different versions of that constructor.  And there\'s no way at all to say <code>Student(name="Eli", age=25)</code></p></li>\n<li><p>Functions can only return 1 thing.

{'answer': '<p>A Hibernate session loads all data it reads from the DB into what they call the <i>first-level cache</i>. Once a row is loaded from the DB, any subsequent fetches for a row with the same PK will return the data from this cache. Furthermore, Hibernate gaurentees reference equality for objects with the same PK in a single Session. </p>\n\n<p>From what I understand, your read-only server application never closes its Hibernate session. So when the DB gets updated by the read-write application, the Session on read-only server is unaware of the change. Effectively, your read-only application is loading an in-memory copy of the database and using that copy, which gets stale in due course.</p>\n\n<p>The simplest and best course of action I can suggest is to close and open Sessions as needed. This sidesteps the whole problem. Hibernate Sessions are intended to be a window for a short-lived interaction with the DB. I agree that there is a performance gain by not reloading the object-graph again and again; but you need to measure it and convince yourself that it is worth the pains.</p>\n\n<p>Another option is to close and reopen the Session periodically. This ensures that the read-only application works with data not older than a given time interval. But there definitely is a window where the read-only application works with stale data (although the design guarantees that it gets the up-to-date data eventually). This might be permissible in many applications - you need to evaluate your situation. </p>\n\n<p>The third option is to use a <i>second level cache</i> implementation, and use short-lived Sessions. There are various caching packages that work with Hibernate with relative merits and demerits.</p>\n', 'questionId': '48733', 'answerId': '50509'}

{'answer': '<p>Firstly "the size of an object" isn\'t a well-defined concept in Java. You could mean the object itself, with just its members, the Object and all objects it refers to (the reference graph). You could mean the size in memory or the size on disk.

{'answer': "<p>Sounds to me like you are treating a symptom: poor design with dependencies on static initialization.  Maybe some refactoring is the real solution.  It sounds like you've already done a little refactoring with your <code>staticInit()</code> function, but maybe that function needs to be called from the constructor, not from a static initializer.  If you can do away with static initializers period, you will be better off.

AFAIK, there is still no support for WPF, WCF, WF, of WIF. Mono can run on iOS, but to my knowledge, the Java runtime still runs on far more platforms than Mono.  Also, Mono is starting to see some much improved tooling (Xamarin), and Microsoft seems to have a much more cross-platform kind of attitude and willingness to work with partners to make them complimentary, rather than competitive (for example, Mono will be a pretty important part of the upcoming OWIN/Helios ASP.NET landscape).

The default acceptor always returns <code>true</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>/** Modified DnDTabbedPane.java\n * http://java-swing-tips.blogspot.com/2008/04/drag-and-drop-tabs-in-jtabbedpane.html\n * originally written by Terai Atsuhiro.\n * so that tabs can be transfered from one pane to another.\n * eed3si9n.\n */\n\nimport java.awt.*;\nimport java.awt.datatransfer.*;\nimport java.awt.dnd.*;\nimport java.awt.geom.*;\nimport java.awt.image.*;\nimport javax.swing.*;\n\npublic class DnDTabbedPane extends JTabbedPane {\n    public static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;\n    private static final int LINEWIDTH = 3;\n    private static final String NAME = "TabTransferData";\n    private final DataFlavor FLAVOR = new DataFlavor(\n            DataFlavor.javaJVMLocalObjectMimeType, NAME);\n    private static GhostGlassPane s_glassPane = new GhostGlassPane();\n\n    private boolean m_isDrawRect = false;\n    private final Rectangle2D m_lineRect = new Rectangle2D.Double();\n\n    private final Color m_lineColor = new Color(0, 100, 255);\n    private TabAcceptor m_acceptor = null;\n\n    public DnDTabbedPane() {\n        super();\n        final DragSourceListener dsl = new DragSourceListener() {\n            public void dragEnter(DragSourceDragEvent e) {\n                e.getDragSourceContext().setCursor(DragSource.DefaultMoveDrop);\n            }\n\n            public void dragExit(DragSourceEvent e) {\n                e.getDragSourceContext()\n                        .setCursor(DragSource.DefaultMoveNoDrop);\n                m_lineRect.setRect(0, 0, 0, 0);\n                m_isDrawRect = false;\n                s_glassPane.setPoint(new Point(-1000, -1000));\n                s_glassPane.repaint();\n            }\n\n            public void dragOver(DragSourceDragEvent e) {\n                //e.getLocation()\n                //This method returns a Point indicating the cursor location in screen coordinates at the moment\n\n                TabTransferData data = getTabTransferData(e);\n                if (data == null) {\n                    e.getDragSourceContext().setCursor(\n                            DragSource.DefaultMoveNoDrop);\n                    return;\n                } // if\n\n                /*\n                Point tabPt = e.getLocation();\n                SwingUtilities.convertPointFromScreen(tabPt, DnDTabbedPane.this);\n                if (DnDTabbedPane.this.contains(tabPt)) {\n                    int targetIdx = getTargetTabIndex(tabPt);\n                    int sourceIndex = data.getTabIndex();\n                    if (getTabAreaBound().contains(tabPt)\n                            &amp;&amp;

{'answer': '<p>Connection reset simply means that a TCP RST was received. This happens when your peer receives data that it can\'t process, and there can be various reasons for that.</p>\n\n<p>The simplest is when you close the socket, and then write more data on the output stream. By closing the socket, you told your peer that you are done talking, and it can forget about your connection. When you send more data on that stream anyway, the peer rejects it with an RST to let you know it isn\'t listening.</p>\n\n<p>In other cases, an intervening firewall or even the remote host itself might "forget" about your TCP connection. This could happen if you don\'t send any data for a long time (2 hours is a common time-out), or because the peer was rebooted and lost its information about active connections. Sending data on one of these defunct connections will cause a RST too.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Update in response to additional information:</em> </p>\n\n<p>Take a close look at your handling of the <code>SocketTimeoutException</code>. This exception is raised if the configured timeout is exceeded while blocked on a socket operation. The state of the socket itself is not changed when this exception is thrown, but if your exception handler closes the socket, and then tries to write to it, you\'ll be in a connection reset condition. <code>setSoTimeout()</code> is meant to give you a clean way to break out of a <code>read()</code> operation that might otherwise block forever, without doing dirty things like closing the socket from another thread.</p>\n', 'questionId': '62929', 'answerId': '63155'}

If you like the cutting edge, or you anticipate more advanced security needs (doesn't sound like you will), then go with WCF.

{'answer': u'<p>Every programming language has its own set of rules and conventions for the kinds of names that you\'re allowed to use, and the Java programming language is no different. The rules and conventions for naming your variables can be summarized as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Variable names are case-sensitive. A variable\'s name can be any legal identifier \u2014 an unlimited-length sequence of Unicode letters and digits, beginning with a letter, the dollar sign "$", or the underscore character "_". The convention, however, is to always begin your variable names with a letter, not "$" or "_". Additionally, the dollar sign character, by convention, is never used at all. You may find some situations where auto-generated names will contain the dollar sign, but your variable names should always avoid using it. A similar convention exists for the underscore character; while it\'s technically legal to begin your variable\'s name with "_", this practice is discouraged. White space is not permitted.</p></li>\n<li><p>Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscore characters. Conventions (and common sense) apply to this rule as well. When choosing a name for your variables, use full words instead of cryptic abbreviations. Doing so will make your code easier to read and understand. In many cases it will also make your code self-documenting; fields named cadence, speed, and gear, for example, are much more intuitive than abbreviated versions, such as s, c, and g. Also keep in mind that the name you choose must not be a keyword or reserved word.</p></li>\n<li><p>If the name you choose consists of only one word, spell that word in all lowercase letters. If it consists of more than one word, capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word. The names gearRatio and currentGear are prime examples of this convention. If your variable stores a constant value, such as <code>static final int NUM_GEARS = 6</code>, the convention changes slightly, capitalizing every letter and separating subsequent words with the underscore character. By convention, the underscore character is never used elsewhere. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>From the official Java Tutorial</p>\n', 'questionId': '65475', 'answerId': '65531'}

All parts of the application area should refer to enums, not constant values, for these constants.  You may declare an enum similar to how you declare a class.  Enums are perhaps the most (and, arguably, only) useful feature of Java 5+.</li>\n<li>If you have constants that are only valid to a particular class or one of its subclasses, declare them as either protected or public and place them on the top class in the hierarchy.  This way, the subclasses can access these constant values (and if other classes access them via public, the constants aren't only valid to a particular class...which means that the external classes using this constant may be too tightly coupled to the class containing the constant)</li>\n<li>If you have an interface with behavior defined, but returned values or argument values should be particular, it is perfectly acceptible to define constants on that interface so that other implementors will have access to them.  However, avoid creating an interface just to hold constants: it can become just as bad as a class created just to hold constants.</li>\n</ul>\n", 'questionId': '66066', 'answerId': '66228'}

For example, all of the\n  boxed numerical primitive classes,\n  such as Integer and Double, export\n  MIN_VALUE and MAX_VALUE constants. If\n  the constants are best viewed as\n  members of an enumerated type, you\n  should export them with an <strong>enum</strong>\n  type. Otherwise, you should export the\n  constants with a noninstantiable\n  utility class.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Constant utility class\npackage com.effectivejava.science;\npublic class PhysicalConstants {\n    private PhysicalConstants() { }  // Prevents instantiation\n\n    public static final double AVOGADROS_NUMBER   = 6.02214199e23;\n    public static final double BOLTZMANN_CONSTANT = 1.3806503e-23;\n    public static final double ELECTRON_MASS      = 9.10938188e-31;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>About the naming convention:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>By convention, such fields have names\n  consisting of capital letters, with\n  words separated by underscores.

Call <code>mTabs.getTabWidget()</code> to get a <code>TabWidget</code> object.  This is just a subclass of <code>ViewGroup</code>, so you can call <code>getChildCount()</code> and <code>getChildAt()</code> to access individual tabs within the <code>TabWidget</code>.  Each of these tabs is also a View, and in the case of a tab with a graphical indicator and a text label, it's almost certainly some other <code>ViewGroup</code> (maybe a <code>LinearLayout</code>, but it doesn't matter) that contains an <code>ImageView</code> and a <code>TextView</code>.  So with a little fiddling with the debugger or <code>Log.i</code>, you should be able to figure out a recipe to get the <code>ImageView</code> and change it directly.</p>\n\n<p>The downside is that if you're not careful, the exact layout of the controls within a tab could change and your app could break.

{'answer': '<p>Okay, I found where I read that.  This is all from "Learning Java" (O\'Reilly 2005):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The problem with a traditional JIT compilation is that optimizing code takes time. So a JIT compiler can produce decent results but may suffer a significant latency when the application starts up. This is generally not a problem for long-running server-side applications but is a serious problem for client-side software and applications run on smaller devices with limited capabilities. To address this, Sun\'s compiler technology, called HotSpot, uses a trick called adaptive compilation. If you look at what programs actually spend their time doing, it turns out that they spend almost all their time executing a relatively small part of the code again and again. The chunk of code that is executed repeatedly may be only a small fraction of the total program, but its behavior determines the program\'s overall performance. Adaptive compilation also allows the Java runtime to take advantage of new kinds of optimizations that simply can\'t be done in a statically compiled language, hence the claim that Java code can run faster than C/C++ in some cases.</p>\n  \n  <p>To take advantage of this fact, HotSpot starts out as a normal Java bytecode interpreter, but with a difference: it measures (profiles) the code as it is executing to see what parts are being executed repeatedly. Once it knows which parts of the code are crucial to performance, HotSpot compiles those sections into optimal native machine code. Since it compiles only a small portion of the program into machine code, it can afford to take the time necessary to optimize those portions. The rest of the program may not need to be compiled at all&mdash;just interpreted&mdash;saving memory and time. In fact, Sun\'s default Java VM can run in one of two modes: client and server, which tell it whether to emphasize quick startup time and memory conservation or flat out performance.</p>\n  \n  <p>A natural question to ask at this point is, Why throw away all this good profiling information each time an application shuts down? Well, Sun has partially broached this topic with the release of Java 5.0 through the use of shared, read-only classes that are stored persistently in an optimized form. This significantly reduces both the startup time and overhead of running many Java applications on a given machine. The technology for doing this is complex, but the idea is simple: optimize the parts of the program that need to go fast, and don\'t worry about the rest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I\'m kind of wondering how far Sun has gotten with it since Java 5.0.</p>\n', 'questionId': '68109', 'answerId': '68199'}

In this way you will develop several servlets, or things like servlets, for each page.

Users can and generally do tolerate a page load, but the page output will be much faster if all the database data is given to the rendering code rather than the rendering code hanging and not giving data to the client while it is trying to read yet another piece of data from the database.</p>\n\n<p>I feel your pain and wish you luck in this endeavor.  Now, when you have to maintain an application that abuses Spring Webflow, that's another story :)</p>\n", 'questionId': '40242', 'answerId': '69121'}

This header can contain useful information (such as the compressed length of the stream, it's offset in the file, CRC) - or it can contain some magic values that basically say 'The information isn't in the stream header, you have to check the Zip post-amble'.</p>\n\n<p>Each zip file then has a table that is attached to the end of the file that contains all of the zip entries, along with the real data.

If you use ZipInputStream, I suspect that getNextEntry() attempts to use the entries embedded in the stream.  If those values aren't specified, then ZipInputStream has no idea how long the stream might be.

{'answer': '<p>Garbage collection is faster (more time efficient) than reference counting, if you have enough memory. For example, a copying gc traverses the "live" objects and copies them to a new space, and can reclaim all the "dead" objects in one step by marking a whole memory region. This is very efficient, <em>if</em> you have enough memory. Generational collections use the knowledge that "most objects die young"; often only a few percent of objects have to be copied.</p>\n\n<p>[This is also the reason why gc can be faster than malloc/free]</p>\n\n<p>Reference counting is much more space efficient than garbage collection, since it reclaims memory the very moment it gets unreachable. This is nice when you want to attach finalizers to objects (e.g. to close a file once the File object gets unreachable). A reference counting system can work even when only a few percent of the memory is free. But the management cost of having to increment and decrement counters upon each pointer assignment cost a lot of time, and some kind of garbage collection is still needed to reclaim cycles.</p>\n\n<p>So the trade-off is clear: if you have to work in a memory-constrained environment, or if you need precise finalizers, use reference counting.

{'answer': '<p>If you define a crash as an process abort because of a unhandled situation (i.e. no Java Exception or Error), then this can not be done from within Java (unless you have permission to use the sun.misc.Unsafe class).

Another source could be illegal machine instructions (opcodes) or unhandled signals from library or kernel calls. Both can be triggered if the JVM or the system libraries have bugs.</p>\n\n<p>For example JITed (generated) code, native methods or system calls (graphics driver) can have problems leading to real crashes (it was quite common to get a crash when you used ZIP functions and they ran out of memory). In those cases the crash handler of the JVM kicks in and dumps the state. It could also generate a OS core file (Dr. Watson on Windows and core dump on *nix).</p>\n\n<p>On Linux/Unix you can easyly make a JVM crash by sending it a Signal to the running process.

{'answer': "<p>From a design perspective, I think it is wrong to require a static implementation member...  The relative deference between performance and memory usage between static and not for the example string is minimal.  That aside, I understand that in implementation the object in question could have a significantly larger foot print...</p>\n\n<p>The essential problem is that by trying to setup a model to support static implementation members that are avaialble at a base or interface level with C# is that our options are limited...  Only properties and methods are available at the interface level.</p>\n\n<p>The next design challenge is whether the code will be base or implementation specific.  With implementation your model will get some valdiation at compile time at the code of having to include similar logic in all implementations.  With base your valdiation will occur at run time but logic would be centralized in one place.  Unfortunately, the given example is the perfect show case for implemntation specific code as there is no logic associated with the data.</p>\n\n<p>So for sake of the example, lets assume there is some actual logic associated with the data and that it is extensive nad/or complex enough to provide a showcase for base classing.  Setting aside whether the base class logic uses any impelementation details or not, we have the problem of insuring implemtation static initialization.  I would recommend using an protected abstract in the base class to force all implementations to created the needed static data that would be valdated at compile time.  All IDE's I work with make this very quick any easy.  For Visual Studio it only takes a few mouse clicks and then just changing the return value essentially.</p>\n\n<p>Circling back to the very specific nature of the question and ignoring many of the other design problems...  If you really must keep this entire to the nature of static data and still enforce it thru the nature confines of the problem...  Definately go with a method over properties, as there are way to many side effects to make go use of properties.  Use a static member on the base class and use a static constructor on the implementations to set the name.  Now keep in mind that you have to valdiate the name at run-time and not compile time.  Basically the GetName method on the base class needs to handle what happens when an implementation does not set it's name.  It could throw an exception making it brutally apparent that something is worng with an implementation that was hopefulyl cause by testing/QA and not a user.  Or you could use reflection to get the implementation name and try to generate a name...  The problem with reflection is that it could effect sub classes and set up a code situation that would be difficult for a junior level developer to understand and maintain...</p>\n\n<p>For that matter you could always generate the name from the class name thru reflection...  Though in the long term this could be a nightmare to maintain...  It would however reduce the amount of code needed on the implementations, which seems more important than any other concerns.  Your could also use attributes here as well, but then you are adding code into the implementations that is equivalent in time/effort as a static constructor and still have the problem off what todo when the implementation does not include that information.</p>\n", 'questionId': '66505', 'answerId': '74982'}

{'answer': "<p>I have found the C++ behavior very annoying. You cannot write virtual functions to, for instance, return the desired size of the object, and have the default constructor initialize each item.

If this really was a problem then the constructor would not be allowed to call <em>any</em> methods, since the same problem can apply to methods for the base class.</p>\n\n<p>Another point against C++ is that the behavior is much less efficient. Although the constructor knows directly what it calls, the vtab pointer has to be changed for every single class from base to final, because the constructor might call other methods that will call virtual functions. From my experience this wastes far more time than is saved by making virtual functions calls in the constructor more efficient.</p>\n\n<p>Far more annoying is that this is also true of destructors. If you write a virtual cleanup() function, and the base class destructor does cleanup(), it certainly does not do what you expect.</p>\n\n<p>This and the fact that C++ calls destructors on static objects on exit have really pissed me off for a long time.</p>\n", 'questionId': '36832', 'answerId': '77445'}

And not just because they\'re open source so that you can rewrite them. Some of these tools come with applications or "hooks" that allow them to be extended. For example, PMD comes with the <a href="http://pmd.sourceforge.net/howtowritearule.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">"designer" tool</a> that allows you to create new rules. Also, Checkstyle has the <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config_misc.html#DescendantToken" rel="nofollow noreferrer">DescendantToken</a> check that has properties that allow for substantial customization.</p>\n\n<p><p>I integrate these tools with <a href="http://virtualteamtls.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/virtualteamtls/trunk/scm/common.xml?view=markup" rel="nofollow noreferrer">an Ant-based build</a>. You can follow the link to see my commented configuration.</p>\n\n<p><p>In addition to the simple integration into the build, I find it helpful to configure the tools to be somewhat "integrated" in a couple of other ways. Namely, report generation and warning suppression uniformity. I\'d like to add these aspects to this discussion (which should probably have the "static-analysis" tag also): how are folks configuring these tools to create a "unified" solution? (I\'ve asked this question separately <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79918/configuring-static-analysis-tools-for-uniformity">here</a>)</p>\n\n<p><p>First, for warning reports, I transform the output so that each warning has the simple format:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/absolute-path/filename:line-number:column-number: warning(tool-name): message</code></pre>\n\n<p><p>This is often called the "Emacs format," but even if you aren\'t using Emacs, it\'s a reasonable format for homogenizing reports. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/project/src/com/example/Foo.java:425:9: warning(Checkstyle):Missing a Javadoc comment.</code></pre>\n\n<p><p>My warning format transformations are done by my Ant script with Ant <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/filterchain.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">filterchains</a>.</p>\n\n<p><p>The second "integration" that I do is for warning suppression. By default, each tool supports comments or an annotation (or both) that you can place in your code to silence a warning that you want to ignore. But these various warning suppression requests do not have a consistent look which seems somewhat silly. When you\'re suppressing a warning, you\'re suppressing a warning, so why not always write "<code>SuppressWarning</code>?"</p>\n\n<p><p>For example, PMD\'s default configuration suppresses warning generation on lines of code with the string "<code>NOPMD</code>" in a comment. Also, PMD supports Java\'s <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation. I configure PMD to use comments containing "<code>SuppressWarning(PMD.</code>" instead of <code>NOPMD</code> so that PMD suppressions look alike. I fill in the particular rule that is violated when using the comment style suppression:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// SuppressWarnings(PMD.PreserveStackTrace) justification: (false positive) exceptions are chained</code></pre>\n\n<p><p>Only the "<code>SuppressWarnings(PMD.</code>" part is significant for a comment, but it is consistent with PMD\'s support for the <code>@SuppressWarning</code> annotation which does recognize individual rule violations by name:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@SuppressWarnings("PMD.CompareObjectsWithEquals") // justification: identity comparision intended</code></pre>\n\n<p><p>Similarly, Checkstyle suppresses warning generation between pairs of comments (no annotation support is provided). By default, comments to turn Checkstyle off and on contain the strings <code>CHECKSTYLE:OFF</code> and <code>CHECKSTYLE:ON</code>, respectively. Changing this configuration (with Checkstyle\'s "SuppressionCommentFilter") to use the strings "<code>BEGIN&nbsp;SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle.</code>" and "<code>END&nbsp;SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle.</code>" makes the controls look more like PMD:</p>\n\n<pre>\n<code>// BEGIN SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField) justification: "Effective Java," 2nd ed., Bloch, Item 2</code>\n<code>// END SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField)</code>\n</pre>\n\n<p><p>With Checkstyle comments, the particular check violation (<code>HiddenField</code>) <em>is</em> significant because each check has its own "<code>BEGIN/END</code>" comment pair.</p>\n\n<p><p>FindBugs also supports warning generation suppression with a <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation, so no further configuration is required to achieve some level of uniformity with other tools. Unfortunately, Findbugs has to support a custom <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation because the built-in Java <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation has a <code>SOURCE</code> retention policy which is not strong enough to retain the annotation in the class file where FindBugs needs it. I fully qualify FindBugs warnings suppressions to avoid clashing with Java\'s <code>@SuppressWarnings</code> annotation:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressWarnings("UWF&#95;FIELD&#95;NOT&#95;INITIALIZED&#95;IN&#95;CONSTRUCTOR")</code></pre>\n\n<p><p>These techniques makes things look reasonably consistent across tools. Note that having each warning suppression contain the string "<code>SuppressWarnings</code>" makes it easy to run a simple search to find all instances for all tools over an entire code base.</p>\n', 'questionId': '4080', 'answerId': '79845'}

{'answer': '<p>WS-Security specifications are not typically contained in a WSDL (never in a WSE WSDL). So wsdl2java does not know that WS-Security is even required for this service. The fact that security constraints are not present in a WSE WSDL is a big disappointment to me (WCF will include WS-Trust information in a WSDL).</p>\n\n<p>On the client end, you\'ll need to use <a href="http://ws.apache.org/rampart/" rel="noreferrer">Rampart</a> to add the necessary WS-Security headers to your outgoing client message. Since the WSDL does not report what WS-Security settings are necessary, you\'re best off by asking the service provider what is required. WS-Security requirements may be simple plaintext password, or might be X509 certificates, or might be encrypted message..... Rampart should be able to handle most of these scenarios.</p>\n\n<p>Apache Rampart is "turned on" by engaging the module in your axis2.xml file. You\'ll need to download the Rampart module and put it in a specific place in your axis2 directory, then modify the xml file. You can also engage Rampart programatically (please edit your original question if this is a requirement and I\'ll edit this response).</p>\n\n<p>Depending on how you configure rampart (through other XML files or programatically), it will intercept any outgoing messages and add the necessary WS-Security information to it. I\'ve personally used axis2 with rampart to call a WSE3 service that is secured with UsernameToken in plaintext and it worked great. Similar, but more advanced scenarios should also work.  There are more details on how to set up and get started with Rampart on the site linked above. If you have problems about the specifics of Rampart or how to use Rampart with your particular WSE setup, then edit your question and I\'ll try my best to answer.</p>\n', 'questionId': '16451', 'answerId': '83764'}

This is because some of the generated WSDL-specific functions have general names (e.g. soap_getfault()).</p>\n\n<p>Worse, with Unix ELF linking, these names will cause cross-linking between shared objects, so a FooService fault might be processed by the soap_getfault() for BarService, corrupting memory if the fault detail structures are different.</p>\n\n<p>The workaround for that is to make sure that nothing gSOAP-related is exposed outside the SO they are linked into.

{'answer': '<p>I\'m fairly surprised at how unanimous the sentiment is that <code>getters</code> and setters are fine and good. I suggest the incendiary article by Allen Holub "<a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-09-2003/jw-0905-toolbox.html" rel="noreferrer">Getters And Setters Are Evil</a>". Granted, the title is for shock value, but the author makes valid points.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, if you have <code>getters</code> and <code>setters</code> for each and every private field, you are making those fields as good as public. You\'d be very hard-pressed to change the type of a private field without ripple effects to every class that calls that <code>getter</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, from a strictly OO point of view, objects should be responding to messages (methods) that correspond to their (hopefully) single responsibility. The vast majority of <code>getters</code> and <code>setters</code> don\'t make sense for their constituent objects;<code>Pen.dispenseInkOnto(Surface)</code> makes more sense to me than <code>Pen.getColor()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Getters and setters also encourage users of the class to ask the object for some data, perform a calculation, and then set some other value in the object, better known as procedural programming. You\'d be better served to simply tell the object to do what you were going to in the first place; also known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_%28object-oriented_design%29#Information_Expert" rel="noreferrer">Information Expert</a> idiom.</p>\n\n<p>Getters and setters, however, are necessary evils at the boundary of layers -- UI, persistence, and so forth. Restricted access to a class\'s internals, such as C++\'s friend keyword, Java\'s package protected access, .NET\'s internal access, and the <a href="http://moffdub.wordpress.com/2008/09/17/friend-classes-in-java-and-c-sharp/" rel="noreferrer">Friend Class Pattern</a> can help you reduce the visibility of <code>getters</code> and setters to only those who need them.</p>\n', 'questionId': '126', 'answerId': '98244'}

Because most types of data can be represented as XML, XQuery can also be used to query other types of data. For example, XQuery can be used to query relational data using an XML view of a relational database. This is important because many Internet applications need to integrate information from multiple sources, including data found in web messages, relational data, and various XML sources. XQuery was specifically designed for this kind of data integration.</p>\n\n<p>For example, suppose your company is a financial institution that needs to produce reports of stock holdings for each client. A client requests a report with a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) message, which is represented in XML. In most businesses, the stock holdings data is stored in multiple relational databases, such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, or DB2. XQuery can query both the SOAP message and the relational databases, creating a report in XML.</p>\n\n<p>XQuery is based on the structure of XML and leverages that structure to make it possible to perform queries on any type of data that can be represented as XML, including relational data.

{'answer': "<p>Depending on the device You are trying to communicate with, there may be more parameters than the baud rate, number of data bits, type of parity checking and number of stop bits to consider. If I recall correctly, modems use nine lines of the RS-232C interface. Some devices like, for example cash registers, may use hardware handshaking on RTS/CTS lines or on DTR/STR lines.  </p>\n\n<p>In general it's good to know how the interface works. You can't communicate if the baud rate doesn't match, but wrong setting of other parameters might kind of work. For example You can easily send data to the device expecting 1 stop bit with 2 stop bits set. Problems start when You try to receive data in such case.

{'answer': '<p>Actually reference counting and the strategies used by the Sun JVM are all different types of garbage collection algorithms.</p>\n\n<p>There are two broad approaches for tracking down dead objects: tracing and reference counting. In tracing the GC starts from the "roots" - things like stack references, and traces all reachable (live) objects. Anything that can\'t be reached is considered dead. In reference counting each time a reference is modified the object\'s involved have their count updated. Any object whose reference count gets set to zero is considered dead.</p>\n\n<p>With basically all GC implementations there are trade offs but tracing is usually good for high through put (i.e. fast) operation but has longer pause times (larger gaps where the UI or program may freeze up).

{'answer': '<p>@erickson.</p>\n\n<p>Strings are immutable types. You cannot modify them, only return new string instances.</p>\n\n<p>Because of that, "foo".format() makes little sense, as it would have to be called like</p>\n\n<pre><code>string newString = "foo".format();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The original java authors (and .NET authors), decided that a static method made more sense in this situation, as you are not modifying "foo", but instead calling a format method and passing in an input string.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Heh, this site can be so amusing sometimes. I got downvoted for mentioning the fact that strings are immutable types.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of why Format() would be dumb as an instance method. In .NET (and probably in Java), Replace() is an instance method.</p>\n\n<p>You can do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code> "I Like Wine".Replace("Wine","Beer");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, nothing happens, because Strings are immutable. Replace tries to return a new string, but it is assigned to nothing.</p>\n\n<p>This causes lots of common rookie mistakes like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Contrived Example\ninputText.Replace(" ","%20");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again, nothing happens, instead you have to do :</p>\n\n<pre><code>inputText = inputText.Replace(" ","%20");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, if you understand that strings are immutable, that makes perfect sense. If you don\'t, then you are just confused. The proper place for Replace, would be where Format is, as a static method of String:</p>\n\n<pre><code> inputText = String.Replace(inputText," ", "%20");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now there is no question as to whats going on.</p>\n\n<p>The real question is, why did the authors of these frameworks decide that one should be an instance method, and the other static? In my opinion, both are more elegantly expressed as static methods, but erickson seems to think both belong as instance methods.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of your opinion, the truth is that you are less prone to make a mistake using the static version, and the code is easier to understand (No Hidden Gotchas).</p>\n\n<p>Of course there are some methods that are perfect as instance methods, take String.Length()</p>\n\n<pre><code>int length = "123".Length();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this situation, its obvious we are not trying to modify "123", we just inspecting it, and returning its length...This is a perfect candidate for an instance method.</p>\n\n<p>My simple rules for Instance Methods on Immutable Objects:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you need to return a new instance of the same type, use a static method.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, use an instance method.</li>\n</ul>\n', 'questionId': '47045', 'answerId': '198356'}

{'answer': "<p>Don't do what the developers at my company did. Somebody created an [sic] InvalidArguementException that parallels java.lang.IllegalArgumentException, and we now use it in (literally) hundreds of classes. Both indicate that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument. Talk about a waste...</p>\n\n<p>Joshua Bloch covers this in <em>Effective Java Programming Language Guide</em> [my bible of first resort on Best Practices] <strong>Chapter 8. Exceptions</strong> <em>Item 42: Favor the use of standard exceptions</em>. Here's a bit of what he says,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Reusing preexisting exceptions has several benefits. Chief among these, it makes your API easier to learn and use because <strong>it matches established conventions with which programmers are already familiar</strong> [<em>my emphasis, not Bloch's</em>]. A close second is that programs using your API are easier to read because they aren't cluttered with unfamiliar exceptions. Finally, fewer exception classes mean a smaller memory footprint and less time spent loading classes.</p>\n  \n  <p>The most commonly reused exception is IllegalArgumentException. This is generally the exception to throw when the caller passes in an argument whose value is inappropriate. For example, this would be the exception to throw if the caller passed a negative number in a parameter representing the number of times some action were to be repeated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That said, you should <strong>never</strong> throw Exception itself. Java has a well-chosen, diverse and well-targeted bunch of built-in exceptions that cover most situations <strong>AND</strong> describe the exception that occurred well enough so that you can remedy the cause.</p>\n\n<p>Be friendly to the programmers who have to maintain your code in the future.</p>\n", 'questionId': '26984', 'answerId': '216589'}

At a paper poll, each registered voter is restricted to a particular booth/location and verification is done by name+SSN and a signature.</p>\n\n<p>You might need a high resolution digital signature capture and therefore a touchscreen capture peripheral or a touch screen terminal.  A more sophisticated approach would be a biometric scanner, but that would require government records of thumb/finger prints or retinal scan - I can already see the privacy advocates lining up at the lawyer\'s offices.</p>\n\n<p>Another approach would be for the voter "registrar office" to issue digital keys to each voter prior to the election - a (relatively) short (cryptographically strong) random alpha/numeric key that is entered with the voter\'s name and/or SSN into the application. Knowledge of that key is required for that particular voter in that particular election.  These keys would be issued by post in tamper-evident envelopes, like those used by banks for postal confirmation of wire transfers and delivery of PIN numbers.  The key must include checksum data so that the user can have the entry of it immediately validated and it should be in groups of 4, so something like XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-CCCC.</p>\n\n<p>Any other "secret" knowledge, such as SSN, is likely too easily discovered for a large percentage of the population (though we don\'t seem to be able to make credit-granting organizations understand this), and therefore is unsuitable for authentication.</p>\n\n<p>Vote counting can be done by generating a public key encrypted data file which is transferred (by sneaker net?) to the central system.  This must include the "voting booth" identity information and a record for each voter including their SSN and the digital key (or signature, or biometric data).  Votes with invalid keys are eliminated.  Multiple votes with the same key and same votes are treated as a single vote for that candidate.  Multiple votes with the same key and different votes are flagged for fraud investigation (with the constituent contacted by phone, issued a new key, and directed to revote).</p>\n', 'questionId': '29357', 'answerId': '255594'}

{'answer': '<p>There are some issues worth noticing if you\'re dealing with classes that are persisted using an Object-Relationship Mapper (ORM) like Hibernate, if you didn\'t think this was unreasonably complicated already!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lazy loaded objects are subclasses</strong></p>\n\n<p>If your objects are persisted using an ORM, in many cases you will be dealing with dynamic proxies to avoid loading object too early from the data store. These proxies are implemented as subclasses of your own class. This means that<code>this.getClass() == o.getClass()</code> will return <code>false</code>. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Person saved = new Person("John Doe");\nLong key = dao.save(saved);\ndao.flush();\nPerson retrieved = dao.retrieve(key);\nsaved.getClass().equals(retrieved.getClass()); // Will return false if Person is loaded lazy\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>If you\'re dealing with an ORM, using <code>o instanceof Person</code> is the only thing that will behave correctly.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Lazy loaded objects have null-fields</strong></p>\n\n<p>ORMs usually use the getters to force loading of lazy loaded objects. This means that <code>person.name</code> will be <code>null</code> if <code>person</code> is lazy loaded, even if <code>person.getName()</code> forces loading and returns "John Doe". In my experience, this crops up more often in <code>hashCode()</code> and <code>equals()</code>.</p>\n\n<p><em>If you\'re dealing with an ORM, make sure to always use getters, and never field references in <code>hashCode()</code> and <code>equals()</code>.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Saving an object will change its state</strong></p>\n\n<p>Persistent objects often use a <code>id</code> field to hold the key of the object. This field will be automatically updated when an object is first saved. Don\'t use an id field in <code>hashCode()</code>. But you can use it in <code>equals()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>A pattern I often use is</p>\n\n<pre><code>if (this.getId() == null) {\n    return this == other;\n}\nelse {\n    return this.getId().equals(other.getId());\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But: you cannot include <code>getId()</code> in <code>hashCode()</code>. If you do, when an object is persisted, its <code>hashCode</code> changes. If the object is in a <code>HashSet</code>, you\'ll "never" find it again.</p>\n\n<p>In my <code>Person</code> example, I probably would use <code>getName()</code> for <code>hashCode</code> and <code>getId()</code> plus <code>getName()</code> (just for paranoia) for <code>equals()</code>. It\'s okay if there are some risk of "collisions" for <code>hashCode()</code>, but never okay for <code>equals()</code>.</p>\n\n<p><em><code>hashCode()</code> should use the non-changing subset of properties from <code>equals()</code></em></p>\n', 'questionId': '27581', 'answerId': '256447'}

Unlike almost every other Java GUI builder, Abeille does not generate code by default. In the project I used it on, it was wonderful to avoid reading or scrolling through the layout code (because that code no longer existed). Most of our hand-written code concerned itself with connecting events to actions, simply asking the layout for the relevant controls.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s a crime that code generation is the default way to layout code in Java because better ways of doing GUIs have been around for decades. I have used Matisse, the NetBeans GUI code generator. While Matisse (now known as "<a href="http://netbeans.org/features/java/swing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Swing GUI Builder</a>") makes it pleasant to layout components, it is similar to all other code generation tools because when you use Matisse you must live in constant fear that someone else edited the "you cannot edit this in NetBeans" GUI sections outside of NetBeans. As soon as you touch the layout builder again it could destroy their work and then you have a broken GUI. There might be some simple task like re-ordering a variable initialization and its use or re-naming a variable (this was especially a problem when using Matisse\'s database feature). You know how to do this by editing the un-editable source code but may waste time trying to figure out how to do the same thing in the GUI builder.

{'answer': '<p>Summary of the long answer below: to solve the problem that I had (restricting server and callback ports at either end of the RMI connection), I needed to create two pairs of client and server socket factories.</p>\n\n<p>Longer answer ensues:</p>\n\n<p>Our solution to the callback problem had essentially three parts.  The first was the object wrapping which needed the ability to specify that it was being used for a client to server connection vs. being used for a server to client callback.  Using an extension of <code>UnicastRemoteObject</code> gave us the ability to specify the client and server socket factories that we wanted to use.  However, the best place to lock down the socket factories is in the constructor of the remote object.  </p>\n\n<pre><code>public class RemoteObjectWrapped extends UnicastRemoteObject {\n// ....\nprivate RemoteObjectWrapped(final boolean callback) throws RemoteException {\n  super((callback ? RemoteConnectionParameters.getCallbackPort() : RemoteConnectionParameters.getServerSidePort()),\n        (callback ? CALLBACK_CLIENT_SOCKET_FACTORY : CLIENT_SOCKET_FACTORY),\n        (callback ? CALLBACK_SERVER_SOCKET_FACTORY : SERVER_SOCKET_FACTORY));\n}\n// ....\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, the first argument specifies the part on which the object is expecting requests, whereas the second and third specify the socket factories that will be used at either end of the connection driving this remote object.</p>\n\n<p>Since we wanted to restrict the ports used by the connection, we needed to extend the RMI socket factories and lock down the ports.  Here are some sketches of our server and client factories:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class SpecifiedServerSocketFactory implements RMIServerSocketFactory {\n/** Always use this port when specified. */\nprivate int serverPort;\n/**\n * @param ignoredPort This port is ignored.  \n * @return a {@link ServerSocket} if we managed to create one on the correct port.\n * @throws java.io.IOException\n */\n@Override\npublic ServerSocket createServerSocket(final int ignoredPort) throws IOException {\n    try {\n        final ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(this.serverPort);\n        return serverSocket;\n    } catch (IOException ioe) {\n        throw new IOException("Failed to open server socket on port " + serverPort, ioe);\n    }\n}\n// ....\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that the server socket factory above ensures that only the port that you previously specified will ever be used by this factory.  The client socket factory has to be paired with the appropriate socket factory (or you\'ll never connect).</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class SpecifiedClientSocketFactory implements RMIClientSocketFactory, Serializable {\n/** Serialization hint */\npublic static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;\n/** This is the remote port to which we will always connect. */\nprivate int remotePort;\n/** Storing the host just for reference. */\nprivate String remoteHost = "HOST NOT YET SET";\n// ....\n/**\n * @param host The host to which we are trying to connect\n * @param ignoredPort This port is ignored.  \n * @return A new Socket if we managed to create one to the host.\n * @throws java.io.IOException\n */\n@Override\npublic Socket createSocket(final String host, final int ignoredPort) throws IOException {\n    try {\n        final Socket socket = new Socket(host, remotePort);\n        this.remoteHost = host;\n        return socket;\n    } catch (IOException ioe) {\n        throw new IOException("Failed to open a socket back to host " + host + " on port " + remotePort, ioe);\n    }\n}\n// ....\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, the only thing remaining to force your two way connection to stay on the same set of ports is some logic to recognize that you are calling back to the client-side.  In that situation, just make sure that your factory method for the remote object calls the RemoteObjectWrapper constructor up top with the callback parameter set to true.</p>\n', 'questionId': '56687', 'answerId': '303081'}

{'answer': "<p>It's not just a matter of the ability to recover from the exception. What matter most, in my opinion, is whether the caller is interested in catching the exception or not.</p>\n\n<p>If you write a library to be used elsewhere, or a lower-level layer in your application, ask yourself if the caller is interested in catching (knowing about) your exception. If he is not, then use an unchecked exception, so you don't burden him unnecessarily.</p>\n\n<p>This is the philosophy used by many frameworks. Spring and hibernate, in particularly, come to mind - they convert known checked exception to unchecked exception precisely because checked exceptions are overused in Java. One example that I can think of is the JSONException from json.org, which is a checked exception and is mostly annoying - it should be unchecked, but the developer simply haven't thought it through.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, most of the time the caller's interest in the exception is directly correlated to the ability to recover from the exception, but that is not always the case.</p>\n", 'questionId': '27578', 'answerId': '322801'}
{'answer': '<p>You\'re correct. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Unchecked exceptions</strong> are used to let the system <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast" rel="noreferrer">fail fast</a> which is a good thing. You should clearly state what is your method expecting in order to work properly.  This way you can validate the input only once.</p>\n\n<p>For instance:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/**\n * @params operation - The operation to execute.\n * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the operation is "exit"\n */\n public final void execute( String operation ) {\n     if( "exit".equals(operation)){\n          throw new IllegalArgumentException("I told you not to...");\n     }\n     this.operation = operation; \n     .....  \n }\n private void secretCode(){\n      // we perform the operation.\n      // at this point the opreation was validated already.\n      // so we don\'t worry that operation is "exit"\n      .....  \n }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Just to put an example. The point is, if the system fails fast, then you\'ll know where and why it did fail.  You\'ll get an stacktrace like:</p>\n\n<pre><code> IllegalArgumentException: I told you not to use "exit" \n at some.package.AClass.execute(Aclass.java:5)\n at otherPackage.Otherlass.delegateTheWork(OtherClass.java:4569)\n ar ......\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And you\'ll know what happened. The OtherClass in the "delegateTheWork" method ( at line 4569 ) called your class with the "exit" value, even when it shouldn\'t  etc.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise you would have to sprinkle validations all over your code and that\'s error prone. Plus, sometimes it is hard to track what went wrong and you may expect hours of frustrating  debugging </p>\n\n<p>Same thing happens with NullPointerExceptions. If you have a 700 lines class with some 15 methods, that uses 30 attributes and none of them can be null, instead of validating in each of those methods for nullability you could make all those attributes read-only and validate them in the constructor or factory method.</p>\n\n<pre><code> public static MyClass createInstane( Object data1, Object data2 /* etc */ ){ \n      if( data1 == null ){ throw NullPointerException( "data1 cannot be null"); }\n\n  }\n\n\n  // the rest of the methods don\'t validate data1 anymore.\n  public void method1(){ // don\'t worry, nothing is null \n      ....\n  }\n  public void method2(){ // don\'t worry, nothing is null \n      ....\n  }\n  public void method3(){ // don\'t worry, nothing is null \n      ....\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Checked exceptions</strong> Are useful when the programmer ( you or your co-workers ) did everything right, validated the input, ran tests, and all the code is perfect, but the code connects to a third party webservice that may be down ( or a file you were using  was deleted by another external process etc ) . The webservice may even be validate before the connection is attempted, but during the data transfer something went wrong.</p>\n\n<p>In that scenario there is nothing that you or your co-workers can do to help it. But still you have to do something and not let the application just die and disappear in the eyes of the user.  You use a checked exception for that and handle the exception, what can you do when that happens?, most of the time , just to attempt to log the error, probably save your work ( the app work ) and present a message to the user. ( The site blabla is down, please retry later etc. ) </p>\n\n<p>If the checked exception are overused ( by  adding the "throw Exception" in the all the methods signatures ) , then your code will become very fragile, because everyone will ignore that exception ( because is too general ) and the quality of code will be seriously compromised.</p>\n\n<p>If you overuse unchecked exception something similar will happen. The users of that code don\'t know if something may go wrong an a lot of try{...}catch( Throwable t ) will appear.</p>\n', 'questionId': '27578', 'answerId': '322889'}

{'answer': "<p>I have a similar task and I am also considering different frameworks. I have some experience with Eclipse (~4 months developing RCP) and now Netbeans (played around for a couple of days). IMHO these frameworks are too complicated. You just end up debugging into Eclipse-specific plugin loaders trying to figure out why you get a ClassNotFoundException or a NullPointer. The same story with NetBeans: somehow somewhere somewhat reads out xml config files and creates UI from that, cool, as long as you follow the tutorial. And of course you can't develop and Eclipse-based RCP using some other IDE, NB is also very jealous about its usage (unless you do some hacks like I did).\nWhat I'm lacking is a clear way to debug my threads from main to action performed. Instead I'm always told what I have to do to avoid exceptions. And so I have to keep my fingers crossed each time I'm trying to pull something new. And it never works out the first time.\nNow I thought about the features I need and I looked out for smaller projects that aim at specific functionality like plugin management eg. And there are plenty. Just compile a list of the functionality you need and start adding smaller frameworks by integrating them into your project.

That\'s what CCP did for EVE Online (<a href="http://myeve.eve-online.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=584" rel="noreferrer">StacklessIO</a>), that\'s what Blizzard did for World of Warcraft (although they do use many third-party libraries), that\'s what Mythic did for Warhammer Online (although they are based on Gamebryo).</p>\n\n<p>However, if you aim to be a small, niche MMO (like the dozens of Free-to-Play/Itemshop MMOs), then getting the Network stuff right is just insanely hard, data consistency is even harder and scalability is the biggest b*tch.</p>\n\n<p>But game technology is not your only problem - you also need to tackle Billing.

{'answer': '<p>Java Generics are <strong>massively</strong> different to C++ templates.</p>\n\n<p>Basically in C++ templates are basically a glorified preprocessor/macro set (<strong>Note:</strong> since some people seem unable to comprehend an analogy, I\'m not saying template processing is a macro).  In Java they are basically syntactic sugar to minimize boilerplate casting of Objects.  Here is a pretty decent <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090323084529/http://www.mindview.net/WebLog/log-0061" rel="noreferrer">introduction to C++ templates vs Java generics</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To elaborate on this point: when you use a C++ template, you\'re basically creating another copy of the code, just as if you used a <code>#define</code> macro.  This allows you to do things like have <code>int</code> parameters in template definitions that determine sizes of arrays and such.</p>\n\n<p>Java doesn\'t work like that.  In Java all objects extent from <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html" rel="noreferrer">java.lang.Object</a> so, pre-Generics, you\'d write code like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class PhoneNumbers {\n  private Map phoneNumbers = new HashMap();\n\n  public String getPhoneNumber(String name) {\n    return (String)phoneNumbers.get(name);\n  }\n\n  ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>because all the Java collection types used Object as their base type so you could put anything in them.  Java 5 rolls around and adds generics so you can do things like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class PhoneNumbers {\n  private Map&lt;String, String&gt; phoneNumbers = new HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;();\n\n  public String getPhoneNumber(String name) {\n    return phoneNumbers.get(name);\n  }\n\n  ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And that\'s all Java Generics are: wrappers for casting objects.  That\'s because Java Generics aren\'t refined.  They use type erasure.  This decision was made because Java Generics came along so late in the piece that they didn\'t want to break backward compatibility (a <code>Map&lt;String, String&gt;</code> is usable whenever a <code>Map</code> is called for).  Compare this to .Net/C# where type erasure isn\'t used, which leads to all sorts of differences (e.g. you can use primitive types and <code>IEnumerable</code> and <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> bear no relation to each other).</p>\n\n<p>And a class using generics compiled with a Java 5+ compiler is usable on JDK 1.4 (assuming it doesn\'t use any other features or classes that require Java 5+).</p>\n\n<p>That\'s why Java Generics are called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar" rel="noreferrer">syntactic sugar</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But this decision on how to do generics has profound effects so much so that the (superb) <a href="http://www.angelikalanger.com/GenericsFAQ/JavaGenericsFAQ.html" rel="noreferrer">Java Generics FAQ</a> has sprung up to answer the many, many questions people have about Java Generics.</p>\n\n<p>C++ templates have a number of features that Java Generics don\'t:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Use of primitive type arguments.</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>template&lt;class T, int i&gt;\nclass Matrix {\n  int T[i][i];\n  ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Java does not allow the use of primitive type arguments in generics.</p></li>\n<li><p>Use of <a href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.xlcpp8a.doc/language/ref/default_args_for_templ_params.htm" rel="noreferrer">default type arguments</a>, which is one feature I miss in Java but there are backwards compatibility reasons for this;</p></li>\n<li>Java allows bounding of arguments.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ObservableList&lt;T extends List&gt; {\n  ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It really does need to be stressed that template invocations with different arguments really are different types.  They don\'t even share static members.

{'answer': "<p>Another feature that C++ templates have that Java generics don't is specialization.  That allows you to have a different implementation for specific types.  So you can, for example, have a highly optimized version for an <em>int</em>, while still having a generic  version for the rest of the types.  Or you can have different versions for pointer and non-pointer types.  This comes in handy if you want to operate on the dereferenced object when handed a pointer.</p>\n", 'questionId': '36347', 'answerId': '499289'}

{'answer': '<p>Intersection types allow you to (kinda sorta) do enums that have an inheritance hierarchy. You can\'t inherit implementation, but you can delegate it to a helper class.</p>\n\n<pre><code>enum Foo1 implements Bar {}\nenum Foo2 implements Bar {}\n\nclass HelperClass {\n   static &lt;T extends Enum&lt;T&gt; &amp; Bar&gt; void fooBar(T the enum) {}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is useful when you have a number of different enums that implement some sort of pattern. For instance, a number of pairs of enums that have a parent-child relationship.</p>\n\n<pre><code>enum PrimaryColor {Red, Green, Blue;}\nenum PastelColor {Pink, HotPink, Rockmelon, SkyBlue, BabyBlue;}\n\nenum TransportMedium {Land, Sea, Air;}\nenum Vehicle {Car, Truck, BigBoat, LittleBoat, JetFighter, HotAirBaloon;}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can write generic methods that say "Ok, given an enum value thats a parent of some other enum values, what percentage of all the possible child enums of the child type have this particular parent value as their parent?", and have it all typesafe and done without casting. (eg: that "Sea" is 33% of all possible vehicles, and "Green" 20% of all possible Pastels).</p>\n\n<p>The code look like this. It\'s pretty nasty, but there are ways to make it better.

Especially in large, multi-project situations with many users, those users may tend to be familiar with only one or two of the projects in the repository. But the projects-as-branch-siblings tends to de-emphasize project individuality and focus on the entire set of projects as a single entity. That\'s a social issue though. We like our originally suggested arrangement for purely practical reasons\u2014it\'s easier to ask about (or modify, or migrate elsewhere) the entire history of a single project when there\'s a single repository path that holds the entire history\u2014past, present, tagged, and branched\u2014for that project and that project alone."</p>\n\n<p>For my own, I tend to agree quite strongly with this and prefer the following layout:\n/\n   utils/\n      calc/\n         trunk/\n         tags/\n         branches/\n      calendar/\n         trunk/\n         tags/\n         branches/\n      \u2026\n   office/\n      spreadsheet/\n         trunk/\n         tags/\n         branches/</p>\n\n<p>The reason are simply that its impractical to tag a complete project set when one would want to tag only a specific subset.</p>\n\n<p>Let\'s use an example: If project-1 depends on moduleA v1.1 and moduleB v2.3, I don\'t want newer moduleA v2.x to appear in the tags. In fact, when coming back some days/weeks/months later to this tagged release, I would be forced to open the bundle descriptor in the tagged version of project-1 to read the version of moduleA actually required.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, if I have to make a specific backup of this release\'s sources onto a CD, I just want to export this tag without downloading hundreds of megabytes of unrelated stuff.</p>\n\n<p>It was just my two cents.</p>\n', 'questionId': '14397', 'answerId': '610268'}

{'answer': '<p>You can never pass by reference in Java, and one of the ways that is obvious is when you want to return more than one value from a method call. Consider the following bit of code in C++:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void getValues(int&amp; arg1, int&amp; arg2) {\n    arg1 = 1;\n    arg2 = 2;\n}\nvoid caller() {\n    int x;\n    int y;\n    getValues(x, y);\n    cout &lt;&lt; "Result: " &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; endl;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Sometimes you want to use the same pattern in Java, but you can\'t; at least not directly. Instead you could do something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void getValues(int[] arg1, int[] arg2) {\n    arg1[0] = 1;\n    arg2[0] = 2;\n}\nvoid caller() {\n    int[] x = new int[1];\n    int[] y = new int[1];\n    getValues(x, y);\n    System.out.println("Result: " + x[0] + " " + y[0]);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As was explained in previous answers, in Java you\'re passing a pointer to the array as a value into <code>getValues</code>. That is enough, because the method then modifies the array element, and by convention you\'re expecting element 0 to contain the return value. Obviously you can do this in other ways, such as structuring your code so this isn\'t necessary, or constructing a class that can contain the return value or allow it to be set. But the simple pattern available to you in C++ above is not available in Java.</p>\n', 'questionId': '40480', 'answerId': '623155'}

{'answer': u'<h1>Ctrl-2 something</h1>\n\n<p>Seems that nobody mentioned Ctrl-2 L (assign to new local variable) and Ctrl-2 F (assign to a new field), these ones have changed how I write code.</p>\n\n<p>Previously, I was typing, say (| is cursor location):</p>\n\n<pre><code>Display display = new |\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then I pushed Ctrl-Space to complete the constructor call. Now I type:</p>\n\n<pre><code>new Display()|\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and press Ctrl-2 L, which results in:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Display display = new Display()|\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This really speeds things up. (Ctrl-2 F does the same, but assigns to a new field rather than a new variable.)</p>\n\n<p>Another good shortcut is Ctrl-2 R: rename in file. It is much faster than rename refactoring (Alt-Shift-R) when renaming things like local variables.</p>\n\n<p>Actually I went to Keys customization preference page and assigned all sorts of additional quick fixes to Ctrl-2-something. For example I now press Ctrl-2 J to split/join variable declaration, Ctrl-2 C to extract an inner class into top-level, Ctrl-2 T to add throws declaration to the function, etc. There are tons of assignable quick fixes, go pick your favourite ones and assign them to Ctrl-2 shortcuts.</p>\n\n<h1>Templates</h1>\n\n<p>Another favourite of mine in my \u201cnpe\u201d template, defined as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if (${arg:localVar} == null)\n    throw new ${exception:link(NullPointerException,IllegalArgumentException)}("${arg:localVar} is null");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This allows me to quickly add null argument checks at the start of every function (especially ones that merely save the argument into a field or add it into a collection, especially constructors), which is great for detecting bugs early.</p>\n\n<p>See more useful templates at <a href="http://www.tarantsov.com/eclipse/templates/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">www.tarantsov.com/eclipse/templates/</a>.

{'answer': '<p>As far as I know, Java only knows call by value. This means for primitive datatypes you will work with an copy and for objects you will work with an copy of the reference to the objects. However I think there are some pitfalls; for example, this will not work:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static void swap(StringBuffer s1, StringBuffer s2) {\n    StringBuffer temp = s1;\n    s1 = s2;\n    s2 = temp;\n}\n\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    StringBuffer s1 = new StringBuffer("Hello");\n    StringBuffer s2 = new StringBuffer("World");\n    swap(s1, s2);\n    System.out.println(s1);\n    System.out.println(s2);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will populate Hello World and not World Hello because in the swap function you use copys which have no impact on the references in the main. But if your objects are not immutable you can change it for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static void appendWorld(StringBuffer s1) {\n    s1.append(" World");\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    StringBuffer s = new StringBuffer("Hello");\n    appendWorld(s);\n    System.out.println(s);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will populate Hello World on the command line. If you change StringBuffer into String it will produce just Hello because String is immutable. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static void appendWorld(String s){\n    s = s+" World";\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    String s = new String("Hello");\n    appendWorld(s);\n    System.out.println(s);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However you could make a wrapper for String like this which would make it able to use it with Strings:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class StringWrapper {\n    public String value;\n\n    public StringWrapper(String value) {\n        this.value = value;\n    }\n}\n\npublic static void appendWorld(StringWrapper s){\n    s.value = s.value +" World";\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    StringWrapper s = new StringWrapper("Hello");\n    appendWorld(s);\n    System.out.println(s.value);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>edit: i believe this is also the reason to use StringBuffer when it comes to "adding" two Strings because you can modifie the original object which u can\'t with immutable objects like String is.</p>\n', 'questionId': '40480', 'answerId': '707416'}

{'answer': '<blockquote>\n  <p>I\'ve been reading a lot lately about the next release of Java possibly supporting closures. I feel like I have a pretty firm grasp on what closures are, but I can\'t think of a solid example of how they would make an Object-Oriented language "better."</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, most people who use the term "closure" actually mean "function object", and in this sense, function objects make it possible to write simpler code in certain circumstances such as when you need custom comparators in a sort function.  </p>\n\n<p>For example, in Python:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def reversecmp(x, y):\n   return y - x\n\na = [4, 2, 5, 9, 11]\na.sort(cmp=reversecmp)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This sorts the list a in reverse order by passing the custom comparison functoin reversecmp.  The addition of the lambda operator makes things even more compact:</p>\n\n<pre><code>a = [4, 2, 5, 9, 11]\na.sort(cmp=lambda x, y : y - x)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Java does not have function objects, so it uses "functor classes" to simulate them.  In Java you do the equivalent operation by implementing a custom version of the Comparator class, and passing that to the sort function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class ReverseComparator implements Comparator {\n   public compare(Object x, Object y) {\n      return (Integer) y - (Integer) x;\n   }\n\n...\n\nList&lt;Integer&gt; a = Arrays.asList(4, 2, 5, 9, 11);\nCollections.sort(a, new ReverseComparator());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, it gives the same effect as closures, but is clumsier and more verbose.  However, the addition of anonymous inner classes obviates most of the pain:</p>\n\n<pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; a = Arrays.asList(4, 2, 5, 9, 11);\nComparator reverse = new Comparator() {\n   public Compare(Object x, Object y) {\n       return (Integer) y - (Integer) x;\n   }\n}\nCollections.sort(a, reverse);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So I would say that the combination of functor classes + anonymous inner classes in Java is sufficient to compensate for the lack of true function objects, making their addition unnecessary.</p>\n', 'questionId': '50255', 'answerId': '716716'}
{'answer': "<p>As a Lisp programmer I would wish that the Java community understands the following difference: <strong>functions as objects vs. closures</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>a) <strong>functions can be named or anonymous</strong>. But they can also be objects of themselves. This allows functions to be passed around as arguments, returned from functions or stored in data structures. This means that functions are first class objects in a programming language.</p>\n\n<p>Anonymous functions don't add much to the language, they just allow you to write functions in a shorter way.</p>\n\n<p>b) <strong>A closure is a function plus a binding environment</strong>. Closures can be passed <em>downwards</em> (as parameters) or returned <em>upwards</em> (as return values). This allows the function to refer to variables of its environment, even if the surrounding code is no longer active.</p>\n\n<p>If you have <strong>a)</strong> in some language, then the question comes up what to do about <strong>b)</strong>? There are languages that have <strong>a)</strong>, but not <strong>b)</strong>. In the functional programming world <strong>a)</strong> (functions) and <strong>b</strong> (functions as closures) is nowadays the norm. Smalltalk had <strong>a)</strong> (<em>blocks</em> are anonymous functions) for a long time, but then some dialects of Smalltalk added support for <strong>b)</strong> (blocks as closures).</p>\n\n<p>You can imagine that you get a slightly different programming model, if you add functions and closures to the language. </p>\n\n<p>From a pragmatic view, the anonymous function adds some short notation, where you pass or invoke functions. That can be a good thing.</p>\n\n<p>The closure (function plus binding) allows you for example to create a function that has access to some variables (for example to a counter value). Now you can store that function in an object, access it and invoke it. The context for the function object is now not only the objects it has access to, but also the variables it has access to via bindings. This is also useful, but you can see that variable bindings vs. access to object variables now is an issue: when should be something a <em>lexical</em> variable (that can be accessed in a closure) and when should it be a variable of some object (a <em>slot</em>). When should something be a closure or an object? You can use both in the similar ways. A usual programming exercise for students learning Scheme (a Lisp dialect) is to write a simple object system using closures.</p>\n\n<p>The result is a more complicated programming language and a more complicated runtime model. Too complicated?</p>\n", 'questionId': '50255', 'answerId': '716763'}
{'answer': '<p>Closures in an imperative language (examples: JavaScript, C#, the forthcoming C++ refresh) are not the same as anonymous inner classes.

{'answer': '<p>A few people have said, or implied, that closures are just syntactic sugar - doing what you could already do with anonymous inner classes and making it more convenient to pass parameters in.</p>\n\n<p>They <em>are</em> syntactic sugar in the same sense that Java is syntactic sugar for assembler (that "assembler" could be bytecode, for sake of argument). In other words they raise they level of abstraction, and this is an important concept.</p>\n\n<p>Closures promote the concept of the function-as-object to a first class entity - one that increases the expressiveness of code, rather than cluttering it with even more boilerplate.</p>\n\n<p>An example that\'s close to my heart has already been mentioned by Tom Hawtin - implementing the Execute Around idiom, which is just about the only way to get RAII into Java. <a href="http://www.levelofindirection.com/journal/2009/9/24/raii-and-closures-in-java.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">I wrote a blog entry on exactly that subject</a> a couple of years ago when I first heard closures might be coming.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically, I think the very reason that closures would be good for Java (more expressiveness with less code) may be what rattles many Java advocates. Java has a mindset of "spell everything out the long way". That and the fact that closures are a nod towards a more functional way of doing things - which I also see as a Good Thing, but may water down the pure OO message that many in the Java community hold dear.</p>\n', 'questionId': '50255', 'answerId': '716804'}

What you <em>should</em> be testing is the public contract that the class has with other objects; you should never directly test an object\'s internals. If another developer wants to make a small internal change to the class, which doesn\'t affect the classes public contract, he/she then has to modify your reflection based test to ensure that it works. If you do this repeatedly throughout a project, unit tests then stop being a useful measurement of code health, and start to become a hindrance to development, and an annoyance to the development team.</p>\n\n<p>What I recommend doing instead is using a code coverage tool such as Cobertura, to ensure that the unit tests you write provide decent coverage of the code in private methods.

LATEST refers to the latest released or snapshot version of a particular artifact, the most recently deployed artifact in a particular repository. RELEASE refers to the last non-snapshot release in the repository. In general, it is not a best practice to design software which depends on a non-specific version of an artifact. If you are developing software, you might want to use RELEASE or LATEST as a convenience so that you don\'t have to update version numbers when a new release of a third-party library is released. When you release software, you should always make sure that your project depends on specific versions to reduce the chances of your build or your project being affected by a software release not under your control. Use LATEST and RELEASE with caution, if at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See the <a href="http://www.sonatype.com/books/maven-book/reference/pom-relationships-sect-pom-syntax.html#pom-relationships-sect-latest-release" rel="noreferrer">POM Syntax section of the Maven book</a> for more details.

You can do this with either "-Prelease-profile" or "-DperformRelease=true"</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It\'s worth emphasising that any approach that allows Maven to pick the dependency versions (LATEST, RELEASE, and version ranges) can leave you open to build time issues, as later versions can have different behaviour (for example the dependency plugin has previously switched a default value from true to false, with confusing results).</p>\n\n<p>It is therefore generally a good idea to define exact versions in releases.

{'answer': '<p>I have implemented callback/delegate support in Java using reflection.  Details and working source are <a href="http://www.softwaremonkey.org/Code/Callback" rel="nofollow noreferrer">available on my website</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>How It Works</h2>\n\n<p>There is a principle class named Callback with a nested class named WithParms.  The API which needs the callback will take a Callback object as a parameter and, if neccessary, create a Callback.WithParms as a method variable.  Since a great many of the applications of this object will be recursive, this works very cleanly.</p>\n\n<p>With performance still a high priority to me, I didn\'t want to be required to create a throwaway object array to hold the parameters for every invocation - after all in a large data structure there could be thousands of elements, and in a message processing scenario we could end up processing thousands of data structures a second.</p>\n\n<p>In order to be threadsafe the parameter array needs to exist uniquely for each invocation of the API method, and for efficiency the same one should be used for every invocation of the callback; I needed a second object which would be cheap to create in order to bind the callback with a parameter array for invocation.  But, in some scenarios, the invoker would already have a the parameter array for other reasons.  For these two reasons, the parameter array does not belong in the Callback object.  Also the choice of invocation (passing the parameters as an array or as individual objects) belongs in the hands of the API using the callback enabling it to use whichever invocation is  best suited to its inner workings.</p>\n\n<p>The WithParms nested class, then, is optional and serves two purposes, it contains the parameter object array needed for the callback invocations, and it provides 10 overloaded invoke() methods (with from 1 to 10 parameters) which load the parameter array and then invoke the callback target.</p>\n\n<p>What follows is an example using a callback to process the files in a directory tree.  This is an initial validation pass which just counts the files to process and ensure none exceed a predetermined maximum size. In this case we just create the callback inline with the API invocation.  However, we reflect the target method out as a static value so that the reflection is not done every time.</p>\n\n<pre><code>static private final Method             COUNT =Callback.getMethod(Xxx.class,"callback_count",true,File.class,File.class);\n\n...\n\nIoUtil.processDirectory(root,new Callback(this,COUNT),selector);\n\n...\n\nprivate void callback_count(File dir, File fil) {\n    if(fil!=null) {                                                                             // file is null for processing a directory\n        fileTotal++;\n        if(fil.length()&gt;fileSizeLimit) {\n            throw new Abort("Failed","File size exceeds maximum of "+TextUtil.formatNumber(fileSizeLimit)+" bytes: "+fil);\n            }\n        }\n    progress("Counting",dir,fileTotal);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>IoUtil.processDirectory():</p>\n\n<pre><code>/**\n * Process a directory using callbacks.

And we don\'t have to repeatedly pay the price of defining and implementing an interface for every new use. Of course, the argument <em>for</em> an interface is that it is far more explicit about what to implement (it\'s enforced, not simply documented) - but in practice I have not found it to be a problem to get the callback definition right.</p>\n\n<p>Defining and implementing an interface is not really so bad (unless you\'re distributing applets, as I am, where avoiding creating extra classes actually matters), but where this really shines is when you have multiple callbacks in a single class. Not only is being forced to push them each into a separate inner class added overhead in the deployed application, but it\'s downright tedious to program and all that boiler-plate code is really just "noise".</p>\n', 'questionId': '44912', 'answerId': '2075606'}

My opinion is that English is the language of the realm, and even if you name your variables in a different language, there is little to no point to use any non-ASCII characters in your programming. Leave it up to the language to deal with it if you are handling data that is UTF8: my iPhone program (which involves tons of user data going in between the phone and server) has full UTF8 support, but has no UTF8 in the source code.

{'answer': "<p>Clearly, <code>notify</code> wakes (any) one thread in the wait set, <code>notifyAll</code> wakes all threads in the waiting set. The following discussion should clear up any doubts. <code>notifyAll</code> should be used most of the time. If you are not sure which to use, then use <code>notifyAll</code>.Please see explanation that follows.</p>\n\n<p>Read very carefully and understand. Please send me an email if you have any questions.</p>\n\n<p>Look at producer/consumer (assumption is a ProducerConsumer class with two methods). IT IS BROKEN (because it uses <code>notify</code>) - yes it MAY work - even most of the time, but it may also cause deadlock - we will see why:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public synchronized void put(Object o) {\n    while (buf.size()==MAX_SIZE) {\n        wait(); // called if the buffer is full (try/catch removed for brevity)\n    }\n    buf.add(o);\n    notify(); // called in case there are any getters or putters waiting\n}\n\npublic synchronized Object get() {\n    // Y: this is where C2 tries to acquire the lock (i.e. at the beginning of the method)\n    while (buf.size()==0) {\n        wait(); // called if the buffer is empty (try/catch removed for brevity)\n        // X: this is where C1 tries to re-acquire the lock (see below)\n    }\n    Object o = buf.remove(0);\n    notify(); // called if there are any getters or putters waiting\n    return o;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>FIRSTLY,</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why do we need a while loop surrounding the wait?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We need a <code>while</code> loop in case we get this situation:</p>\n\n<p>Consumer 1 (C1) enter the synchronized block and the buffer is empty, so C1 is put in the wait set (via the <code>wait</code> call). Consumer 2 (C2) is about to enter the synchronized method (at point Y above), but Producer P1 puts an object in the buffer, and subsequently calls <code>notify</code>. The only waiting thread is C1, so it is woken and now attempts to re-acquire the object lock at point X (above).</p>\n\n<p>Now C1 and C2 are attempting to acquire the synchronization lock. One of them (nondeterministically) is chosen and enters the method, the other is blocked (not waiting - but blocked, trying to acquire the lock on the method). Let's say C2 gets the lock first. C1 is still blocking (trying to acquire the lock at X). C2 completes the method and releases the lock. Now, C1 acquires the lock. Guess what, lucky we have a <code>while</code> loop, because, C1 performs the loop check (guard) and is prevented from removing a non-existent element from the buffer (C2 already got it!). If we didn't have a <code>while</code>, we would get an <code>IndexArrayOutOfBoundsException</code> as C1 tries to remove the first element from the buffer!</p>\n\n<p>NOW,</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ok, now why do we need notifyAll?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the producer/consumer example above it looks like we can get away with <code>notify</code>. It seems this way, because we can prove that the guards on the <em>wait</em> loops for producer and consumer are mutually exclusive. That is, it looks like we cannot have a thread waiting in the <code>put</code> method as well as the <code>get</code> method, because, for that to be true, then the following would have to be true:</p>\n\n<p><code>buf.size() == 0 AND buf.size() == MAX_SIZE</code> (assume MAX_SIZE is not 0)</p>\n\n<p>HOWEVER, this is not good enough, we NEED to use <code>notifyAll</code>. Let's see why ...</p>\n\n<p>Assume we have a buffer of size 1 (to make the example easy to follow). The following steps lead us to deadlock. Note that ANYTIME a thread is woken with notify, it can be non-deterministically selected by the JVM - that is any waiting thread can be woken. Also note that when multiple threads are blocking on entry to a method (i.e. trying to acquire a lock), the order of acquisition can be non-deterministic. Remember also that a thread can only be in one of the methods at any one time - the synchronized methods allow only one thread to be executing (i.e. holding the lock of) any (synchronized) methods in the class. If the following sequence of events occurs - deadlock results:</p>\n\n<p><strong>STEP 1:</strong><BR>\n- P1 puts 1 char into the buffer</p>\n\n<p><strong>STEP 2:</strong><BR>\n- P2 attempts <code>put</code> - checks wait loop - already a char - waits</p>\n\n<p><strong>STEP 3:</strong><BR>\n- P3 attempts <code>put</code> - checks wait loop - already a char - waits</p>\n\n<p><strong>STEP 4:</strong><BR>\n- C1 attempts to get 1 char <BR>\n- C2 attempts to get 1 char - blocks on entry to the <code>get</code> method<BR>\n- C3 attempts to get 1 char - blocks on entry to the <code>get</code> method</p>\n\n<p><strong>STEP 5:</strong><BR>\n- C1 is executing the <code>get</code> method - gets the char, calls <code>notify</code>, exits method<BR>\n- The <code>notify</code> wakes up P2<BR>\n- BUT, C2 enters method before P2 can (P2 must reacquire the lock), so P2 blocks on entry to the <code>put</code> method<BR>\n- C2 checks wait loop, no more chars in buffer, so waits<BR>\n- C3 enters method after C2, but before P2, checks wait loop, no more chars in buffer, so waits</p>\n\n<p><strong>STEP 6:</strong><BR>\n- NOW: there is P3, C2, and C3 waiting!<BR>\n- Finally P2 acquires the lock, puts a char in the buffer, calls notify, exits method</p>\n\n<p><strong>STEP 7:</strong><BR>\n- P2's notification wakes P3 (remember any thread can be woken)<BR>\n- P3 checks the wait loop condition, there is already a char in the buffer, so waits.<BR>\n- NO MORE THREADS TO CALL NOTIFY and THREE THREADS PERMANENTLY SUSPENDED!</p>\n\n<p>SOLUTION: Replace <code>notify</code> with <code>notifyAll</code> in the producer/consumer code (above).</p>\n", 'questionId': '37026', 'answerId': '3186336'}

{'answer': "<p>NB: I don't have enough point to comment, so feel free to move this as a comment to appropriate answer.</p>\n\n<p>Contrary to popular believe, which I never understand where it came from, .net implemented true generics without breaking backward compatibility, and they spent explicit effort for that.\nYou don't have to change your non-generic .net 1.0 code into generics just to be used in .net 2.0. Both the generic and non-generic lists are still available in .Net framework 2.0 even until 4.0, exactly for nothing else but backward compatibility reason. Therefore old codes that still used non-generic ArrayList will still work, and use the same ArrayList class as before.\nBackward code compatibility is always maintained since 1.0 till now... So even in .net 4.0, you still have to option to use any non-generics class from 1.0 BCL if you choose to do so.</p>\n\n<p>So I don't think java has to break backward compatibility to support true generics.</p>\n", 'questionId': '31693', 'answerId': '3398108'}

Use an obfuscator if it is that important.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I think the compatibility problems involved in using GCJ greatly outweighs any gains (which I think questionable at best) you might possible derive from it.

Essentially\n  Delegates are objects that encode a method dispatch on a specified\n  object. This document shows how java inner classes provide a more\n  generic solution to such problems.</p>\n  \n  <p>What is a Delegate? Really it is very similar to a pointer to member\n  function as used in C++. But a delegate contains the target object\n  alongwith the method to be invoked. Ideally it would be nice to be\n  able to say:</p>\n  \n  <p>obj.registerHandler(ano.methodOne); </p>\n  \n  <p>..and that the method methodOne would be called on ano when some specific event was received.</p>\n  \n  <p>This is what the Delegate structure achieves.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Java Inner Classes</strong> </p>\n  \n  <p>It has been argued that Java provides this\n  functionality via inner classes and thus does not need the additional\n  Delegate construct.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>obj.registerHandler(new Handler() {\n        public void handleIt(Event ev) {\n            methodOne(ev);\n        }\n      } );\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>At first glance this seems correct but at the same time a nuisance.\n  Because for many event processing examples the simplicity of the\n  Delegates syntax is very attractive.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>General Handler</strong> </p>\n  \n  <p>However, if event-based programming is used in a more\n  pervasive manner, say, for example, as a part of a general\n  asynchronous programming environment, there is more at stake.</p>\n  \n  <p>In such a general situation, it is not sufficient to include only the\n  target method and target object instance. In general there may be\n  other parameters required, that are determined within the context when\n  the event handler is registered.</p>\n  \n  <p>In this more general situation, the java approach can provide a very\n  elegant solution, particularly when combined with use of final\n  variables:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>void processState(final T1 p1, final T2 dispatch) { \n  final int a1 = someCalculation();\n\n  m_obj.registerHandler(new Handler() {\n    public void handleIt(Event ev) {\n     dispatch.methodOne(a1, ev, p1);\n    }\n  } );\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>final * final * final</strong> </p>\n  \n  <p>Got your attention?</p>\n  \n  <p>Note that the final variables are accessible from within the anonymous\n  class method definitions. Be sure to study this code carefully to\n  understand the ramifications. This is potentially a very powerful\n  technique. For example, it can be used to good effect when registering\n  handlers in MiniDOM and in more general situations.</p>\n  \n  <p>By contrast, the Delegate construct does not provide a solution for\n  this more general requirement, and as such should be rejected as an\n  idiom on which designs can be based.</p>\n</blockquote>\n', 'questionId': '44912', 'answerId': '3953773'}

So each time I closed all the connections App A would make a bunch of new connections as per it\'s WEB.xml config file and run happily. App B would do the same. The problem is that they are <em>independent pools</em> which try to grab up to the server defined limit. It is a kind of race condition I guess. So when App A has finished with the connections it sits waiting to to use them again until the timeout has passed while App B who needs the connection now is denied the resources even though App A has finished with the and should be back in the pool. Once the timeout has passed, the connection is freed up and B (or C etc) can get at it again.</p>\n\n<p>e.g. if the limit is 10 (mySQL profile limit) and each app has been configured to use a max of 10 the there will be 20 attempts at connections.

{'answer': '<p>There is a LOT to be said in taking the time to test out the various garbage collection settings, but as was mentioned above it usually not useful to do so.</p>\n\n<p>I am currently working on a project involving a memory-limited environment and a relatively large amounts of data--there are a few large pieces of data that push my environment to its limit, and even though I was able to bring memory usage down so that in theory it should work just fine, I would still get heap space errors---the verbose GC options showed me that it was trying to garbage collect, but to no avail. In the debugger, I could perform System.gc() and sure enough there would be "plenty" of memory available...not a lot of extra, but enough.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, The only time my application calls System.gc() is when it is about to enter the segment of code where large buffers necessary for processing the data will be allocated, and a test on the free memory available indicates that I\'m not guaranteed to have it.  In particular, I\'m looking at a 1gb environment where at least 300mb is occupied by static data, with the bulk of the non-static data being execution-related except when the data being processed happens to be at least 100-200 MB at the source.  It\'s all part of an automatic data conversion process, so the data all exists for relatively short periods of time in the long run.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, while information about the various options for tuning the garbage collector is available, it seems largely an experimental process and the lower level specifics needed to understand how to handle these specific situations are not easily obtained.  </p>\n\n<p>All of that being said, even though I am using System.gc(), I still continued to tune using command line parameters and managed to improve the overall processing time of my application by a relatively significant amount, despite being unable to get over the stumbling block posed by working with the larger blocks of data.   That being said, System.gc() is a tool....a very unreliable tool, and if you are not careful with how you use it, you will wish that it didn\'t work more often than not.</p>\n', 'questionId': '66540', 'answerId': '5217683'}

{'answer': '<p>The real problem with closing OS handles in finalize is that the finalize are executed in no guaranteed order. But if you have handles to the things that block (think e.g. sockets) potentially your code can get into deadlock situation (not trivial at all).</p>\n\n<p>So I\'m for explicitly closing handles in a predictable orderly manner. Basically code for dealing with resources should follow the pattern:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SomeStream s = null;\n...\ntry{\n   s = openStream();\n   ....\n   s.io();\n   ...\n} finally {\n   if (s != null) {\n       s.close();\n       s = null;\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It gets even more complicated if you write your own classes that work via JNI and open handles. You need to make sure handles are closed (released) and that it will happen only once. Frequently overlooked OS handle in Desktop J2SE is <code>Graphics[2D]</code>. Even <code>BufferedImage.getGrpahics()</code> can potentially return you the handle that points into a video driver (actually holding the resource on GPU). If you won\'t release it yourself and leave it  garbage collector to do the work - you may find strange OutOfMemory and alike situation when you ran out of video card mapped bitmaps but still have plenty of memory. In my experience it happens rather frequently in tight loops working with graphics objects (extracting thumbnails, scaling, sharpening you name it).</p>\n\n<p>Basically GC does not take care of programmers responsibility of correct resource management. It only takes care of memory and nothing else. The Stream.finalize calling close() IMHO would be better implemented throwing exception new RuntimeError("garbage collecting the stream that is still open"). It will save hours and days of debugging and cleaning code after the sloppy amateurs left the ends lose.</p>\n\n<p>Happy coding.</p>\n\n<p>Peace.</p>\n', 'questionId': '28949', 'answerId': '5388006'}

{'answer': '<p>I have been thinking a lot about the topic of this <strong>very interesting question</strong> in\nthe last few days. First of all, if I have understood correctly, Java already has\nsome basic notion of closures (defined through anonymous classes) but the new feature\nthat is going to be introduced is the support for closures based on anonymous functions.</p>\n\n<p>This extension will definitely make the language more expressive but I am not sure\nif it really fits with the rest of the language.\nJava has been designed as an object-oriented language with no support for functional programming: Will the new semantics be easy to understand? Java 6 does not even have functions, will Java 7 have anonymous functions but no "normal" functions?</p>\n\n<p>My impression is that as new programming styles or paradigms like functional\nprogramming become more popular, everyone wants to use them in their\nfavourite OOP language. This is understandable: one wants to continue to use\na language they\'re familiar with while adopting new features. But in this way\na language can become really complex and lose coherence.</p>\n\n<p>So my attitude at the moment is to stick to Java 6 for OOP (I hope Java 6 will still\nbe supported for a while) and, in case I really get interested in doing OOP + FP,\nto take a look at some other language like Scala (Scala was defined to be multi-\nparadigm from the beginning and can be well integrated with Java) rather than switching\nto Java 7.</p>\n\n<p>I think Java owes its success to the fact that it combines a simple language with very\npowerful libraries and tools, and I do not think that new features like closures will\nmake it a better programming language.</p>\n', 'questionId': '50255', 'answerId': '6455738'}

If an iterator has been created on a collection object and some other thread tries to modify the collection object "structurally", a concurrent modification exception will be thrown. It is possible for other threads though to invoke "set" method since it doesn\'t modify the collection "structurally".

Map provides a safe way\n to remove entries in the midst of iteration; Hashtable did not.\n Finally, Map fixes a minor deficiency in the Hashtable interface.\n Hashtable has a method called contains, which returns true if the\n Hashtable contains a given value. Given its name, you\'d expect this\n method to return true if the Hashtable contained a given key, because\n the key is the primary access mechanism for a Hashtable.

{'answer': '<p>Unlike others I think there are many reasons why you might <em>always want the latest</em> version. Particularly if you are doing continuous deployment (we sometimes have like 5 releases in a day) and don\'t want to do a multi-module project.</p>\n\n<p>What I do is make Hudson/Jenkins do the following for every build:</p>\n\n<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>mvn clean versions:use-latest-versions scm:checkin deploy -Dmessage="update versions" -DperformRelease=true\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That is I use the versions plugin and scm plugin to update the dependencies and then check it in to source control. Yes I let my CI do SCM checkins (which you have to do anyway for the maven release plugin).</p>\n\n<p>You\'ll want to setup the versions plugin to only update what you want:</p>\n\n<pre class="lang-xml prettyprint-override"><code>        &lt;plugin&gt;\n            &lt;groupId&gt;org.codehaus.mojo&lt;/groupId&gt;\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;versions-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n            &lt;version&gt;1.2&lt;/version&gt;\n            &lt;configuration&gt;\n                &lt;includesList&gt;com.snaphop&lt;/includesList&gt;\n                &lt;generateBackupPoms&gt;false&lt;/generateBackupPoms&gt;\n                &lt;allowSnapshots&gt;true&lt;/allowSnapshots&gt;\n            &lt;/configuration&gt;\n        &lt;/plugin&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I use the release plugin to do the release which takes care of -SNAPSHOT and validates that there is a release version of -SNAPSHOT (which is important).</p>\n\n<p>If you do what I do you will get the latest version for all snapshot builds and the latest release version for release builds. Your builds will also be reproducible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>I noticed some comments asking some specifics of this workflow. I will say we don\'t use this method anymore and the big reason why is the maven versions plugin is buggy and in general is inherently flawed.</p>\n\n<p>It is flawed because to run the versions plugin to adjust versions all the existing versions need to exist for the pom to run correctly. That is the versions plugin cannot update to the latest version of anything if it can\'t find the version referenced in the pom. This is actually rather annoying as we often cleanup old versions for disk space reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Really you need a separate tool from maven to adjust the versions (so you don\'t depend on the pom file to run correctly). I have written such a tool in the the lowly language that is Bash. The script will update the versions like the version plugin and check the pom back into source control. It also runs like 100x faster than the mvn versions plugin. Unfortunately it isn\'t written in a manner for public usage but if people are interested I could make it so and put it in a gist or github.</p>\n\n<p>Going back to workflow as some comments asked about that this is what we do:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>We have 20 or so projects in their own repositories with their own jenkins jobs</li>\n<li>When we release the maven release plugin is used. The workflow of that is covered in the plugin\'s documentation. The maven release plugin sort of sucks (and I\'m being kind) but it does work. One day we plan on replacing this method with something more optimal.</li>\n<li>When one of the projects gets released jenkins then runs a special job we will call the update all versions job (how jenkins knows its a release is a complicated manner in part because the maven jenkins release plugin is pretty crappy as well).</li>\n<li>The update all versions job knows about all the 20 projects. It is actually an aggregator pom to be specific with all the projects in the modules section in dependency order. Jenkins runs our magic groovy/bash foo that will pull all the projects update the versions to the latest and then checkin the poms (again done in dependency order based on the modules section). </li>\n<li>For each project if the pom has changed (because of a version change in some dependency) it is checked in and then we immediately ping jenkins to run the corresponding job for that project (this is to preserve build dependency order otherwise you are at the mercy of the SCM Poll scheduler). </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>At this point I\'m of the opinion it is a good thing to have the release and auto version a separate tool from your general build anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Now you might think maven sort of sucks because of the problems listed above but this actually would be fairly difficult with a build tool that does not have a declarative easy to parse <strong>extendable</strong> syntax (aka XML).</p>\n\n<p>In fact we add custom XML attributes through namespaces to help hint bash/groovy scripts (e.g. don\'t update this version). </p>\n', 'questionId': '30571', 'answerId': '8795380'}

{'answer': '<p>Mono does a better job at targeting the platforms I want to support. Other than that, it is all subjective.</p>\n\n<p>I share C# code across the following platforms:\n- iOS (iPhone/iPad)\n- Android\n- The Web (HTML5)\n- Mac (OS X)\n- Linux\n- Windows</p>\n\n<p>I could share it even more places:\n- Windows Phone 7\n- Wii\n- XBox\n- PS3\n- etc.</p>\n\n<p>The biggie is iOS since <a href="http://xamarin.com/monotouch">MonoTouch</a> works fantastically. I do not know of any good way to target iOS with Java. You cannot target Windows Phone 7 with Java, so I would say that the days of Java being better for mobile are behind us.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest factor for me though is personal productivity (and happiness). C# as a language is years ahead of Java IMHO and the .NET framework is a joy to use. Most of what is being added in Java 7 and Java 8 has been in C# for years. JVM languages like Scala and Clojure (both available on the CLR) are pretty nice though.</p>\n\n<p>I see Mono as a platform in it\'s own right (a great one) and treat .NET as the Microsoft implementation of Mono on Windows. This means that I develop and test on Mono first. This works wonderfully.</p>\n\n<p>If both Java and .NET (Mono let\'s say) were Open Source projects without any corporate backing, I would choose Mono over Java every time. I believe it is just a better platform.</p>\n\n<p>Both .NET/Mono and the JVM are great choices, although I would personally use some other language than Java on the JVM.</p>\n\n<h1>My take on some of the other comments:</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Issue: Performance.</strong></p>\n\n<p>**Answer: Both the JVM and the CLR perform better than detractors say they do. I would say that the JVM performs better. Mono is generally slower than .NET (though not always).</p>\n\n<p>I personally would take ASP.NET MVC over J2EE any day both as a developer and an end-user. Support for <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Release_Notes_Mono_2.10#Google_Native_Client_Support">Google Native Client</a> is pretty cool too. Also, I know that poor GUI performance for desktop Java apps is supposed to be a thing of the past but I keep finding slow ones. Then again, I could say the same for WPF. GTK# is plenty fast though so there is no reason they have to be slow.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Issue: Java has a larger ecosystem of libraries available.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer: Probably true, but it is a non-issue in practice.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Practically every Java library (including the JDK) runs just dandy on .NET/Mono thanks to <a href="http://www.ikvm.net/">IKVM.NET</a>. This piece of technology is a true marvel. The integration is amazing; you can use a Java library just like it was native. I have only had to use Java libraries in one .NET app though. The .NET/Mono ecosystem generally offers more than I need.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Issue: Java has better (broader) tools support</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer: Not on Windows. Otherwise I agree. MonoDevelop is nice though.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I want to give a shout-out to <a href="http://monodevelop.com/">MonoDevelop</a>; it is a jewel. MonoDevelop integrates most of the tools I want use including code completion (intellisense), Git/Subversion integration, support for unit tests, SQL integration, debugging, easy refactoring, and assembly browsing with on-the-fly decompilation. It is wonderful to use the same environment for everything from server-side web to mobile apps.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Issue: Compatibility across platforms.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer: Mono is a single code-base across all platforms, including Windows.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Develop for Mono first and deploy to .NET on Windows if you like. If you compare .NET from MS to Java though then Java has the edge in terms of consistency across platforms. See next answer...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Issue: Mono lags .NET.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer: No it does not.</strong> IMHO, this is an often stated but incorrect statement.</p>\n\n<p>The Mono distribution from Xamarin ships with C#, VB.NET, F#, IronPython, IronRuby, and I think maybe Boo out of the box. The Mono C# compiler is completely up to date with MS. The Mono VB.NET compiler does lag the MS version. The other compilers are the same on both platforms (as are other .NET languages like Nemerle, Boo, and Phalanger (PHP) ).</p>\n\n<p>Mono ships with a lot of the actual Microsoft written code including the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR), Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF), F#, and ASP.NET MVC. Because Razor is not Open Source, Mono currently ships with MVC2 but MVC3 works on Mono just fine.</p>\n\n<p>The core Mono platform has kept pace with .NET or many years and the compatibility is impressive. You can use the full C# 4.0 language and even some C# 5.0 features today. In fact, Mono often leads .NET in many ways.</p>\n\n<p>Mono implements parts of the CLR spec that even Microsoft does not support (like 64 bit arrays). One of the most exciting new pieces of technology in the .NET world is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Roslyn">Rosylyn</a>. Mono has offered the C# compiler as a service for many years. Some of what Rosylyn offers is available via <a href="http://wiki.sharpdevelop.net/NRefactory.ashx">NRefractory</a> as well. An example of were Mono is still ahead would be the SIMD instructions to accelerate gaming performance.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft does offer a number of products on top of .NET that are not available in Mono which is were the misconception about Mono lagging comes from. Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Entity Framework (EF), WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) are examples of products which do not work, or are poorly supported, on Mono. The obvious solution is to use cross-platform alternatives like GTK#, NHibernate, and ServiceStack instead.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Issue: Microsoft is evil.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer: True. So what.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many people offer the following reasons to avoid using Mono:</p>\n\n<p>1) You should not use Mono because Microsoft tech should be avoided</p>\n\n<p>2) Mono sucks because it does not let you use every technology that Microsoft offers</p>\n\n<p>To me, it is clear that these statements are incompatible. I reject the first statement but will skip that argument here. The second statement is true of all .NET alternatives.</p>\n\n<p>The JVM is a great platform and the explosion of JVM languages is awesome. Use what makes you happy. For now, that is often .NET/Mono for me.</p>\n', 'questionId': '61559', 'answerId': '9049008'}

After all, by the point the constructor fails, the object\'s <code>name</code> field has already been initialized, right?</p>\n\n<p>Well, Java can\'t return a partially constructed version of <code>A</code> because the object was not successfully built. The object is in a inconsistent state, and it is therefore discarded by Java. Your variable A is not even initialized, it is kept as null. </p>\n\n<p>Now, as you know, to fully build a new object, all its super classes must be initialized first. If one of the super classes failed to execute, what would be the final state of the object? It is impossible to determine that.</p>\n\n<p>Look at this more elaborate example</p>\n\n<pre><code>class A {\n   private final int a;\n   public A() throws Exception { \n      a = 10;\n   }\n}\n\nclass B extends A {\n   private final int b;\n   public B() throws Exception {\n       methodThatThrowsException(); \n       b = 20;\n   }\n}\n\nclass C extends B {\n   public C() throws Exception { super(); }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the constructor of <code>C</code> is invoked, if an exception occurs while initializing <code>B</code>, what would be the value of the final <code>int</code> variable <code>b</code>?</p>\n\n<p>As such, the object C cannot be created, it is bogus, it is trash, it is not fully initialized.</p>\n\n<p>For me, this explains why your code is illegal.</p>\n', 'questionId': '5328', 'answerId': '10261194'}

Now based on the object you might need to perform some sort of computation . <br/>The provider guarantees that object can be of 3 types and we need to perform computation based on what type of object . <br/>So we might implement in 3 classes each containing a different logic .Obviously the object  information is available in runtime so you cannot statically code to perform computation hence reflection is used to instantiate the object of the class that you require to perform the computation based on the object received from the provider .</p>\n', 'questionId': '37628', 'answerId': '11159447'}
{'answer': '<p>As already stated by Jason Cohen, the Java Language Specification defines what a legal identifier is in section 3.8:</p>\n\n<p>"An identifier is an unlimited-length sequence of Java letters and Java digits, the\nfirst of which must be a Java letter. [...] A \'Java letter\' is a character for which the method Character.isJavaIdentifierStart(int) returns true. A \'Java letter-or-digit\' is a character for which the method Character.isJavaIdentifierPart(int) returns true."</p>\n\n<p>This hopefully answers your second question. Regarding your first question; I\'ve been taught both by teachers and (as far as I can remember) Java compilers that a Java class name should be an identifier that begins with a capital letter A-Z, but I can\'t find any reliable source on this. When trying it out with OpenJDK there are no warnings when beginning class names with lower-case letters or even a $-sign. When using a $-sign, you do have to escape it if you compile from a bash shell, however.</p>\n', 'questionId': '65475', 'answerId': '11209443'}

{'answer': '<p>I have worked out how to calculate sensible dynamic facets for product price ranges.  The solution involves some pre-processing of documents and some post-processing of the query results, but it requires only one query to Solr, and should even work on old version of Solr like 1.4.</p>\n\n<h1>Round up prices before submission</h1>\n\n<p>First, before submitting the document, <strong>round up</strong> the the price to the nearest "nice round facet boundary" and store it in a "rounded_price" field.  Users like their facets to look like "250-500" not "247-483", and rounding also means you get back hundreds of price facets not millions of them.  With some effort the following code can be generalised to round nicely at any price scale:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public static decimal RoundPrice(decimal price)\n    {\n        if (price &lt; 25)\n            return Math.Ceiling(price);\n        else if (price &lt; 100)\n            return Math.Ceiling(price / 5) * 5;\n        else if (price &lt; 250)\n            return Math.Ceiling(price / 10) * 10;\n        else if (price &lt; 1000)\n            return Math.Ceiling(price / 25) * 25;\n        else if (price &lt; 2500)\n            return Math.Ceiling(price / 100) * 100;\n        else if (price &lt; 10000)\n            return Math.Ceiling(price / 250) * 250;\n        else if (price &lt; 25000)\n            return Math.Ceiling(price / 1000) * 1000;\n        else if (price &lt; 100000)\n            return Math.Ceiling(price / 2500) * 2500;\n        else\n            return Math.Ceiling(price / 5000) * 5000;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Permissible prices go 1,2,3,...,24,25,30,35,...,95,100,110,...,240,250,275,300,325,...,975,1000 and so forth.  </p>\n\n<h1>Get all facets on rounded prices</h1>\n\n<p>Second, when submitting the query, request all facets on rounded prices sorted by price: <code>facet.field=rounded_price</code>.  Thanks to the rounding, you\'ll get at most a few hundred facets back.</p>\n\n<h1>Combine adjacent facets into larger facets</h1>\n\n<p>Third, after you have the results, the user wants see only 3 to 7 facets, not hundreds of facets.  So, combine adjacent facets into a few large facets (called "segments") trying to get a roughly equal number of documents in each segment. The following rather more complicated code does this, returning tuples of (start, end, count) suitable for performing range queries.  The counts returned will be correct provided prices were been rounded <em>up</em> to the nearest boundary:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public static List&lt;Tuple&lt;string, string, int&gt;&gt; CombinePriceFacets(int nSegments, ICollection&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;string, int&gt;&gt; prices)\n    {\n        var ranges = new List&lt;Tuple&lt;string, string, int&gt;&gt;();\n        int productCount = prices.Sum(p =&gt; p.Value);\n        int productsRemaining = productCount;\n        if (nSegments &lt; 2)\n            return ranges;\n        int segmentSize = productCount / nSegments;\n        string start = "*";\n        string end = "0";\n        int count = 0;\n        int totalCount = 0;\n        int segmentIdx = 1;\n        foreach (KeyValuePair&lt;string, int&gt; price in prices)\n        {\n            end = price.Key;\n            count += price.Value;\n            totalCount += price.Value;\n            productsRemaining -= price.Value;\n            if (totalCount &gt;= segmentSize * segmentIdx)\n            {\n                ranges.Add(new Tuple&lt;string, string, int&gt;(start, end, count));\n                start = end;\n                count = 0;\n                segmentIdx += 1;\n            }\n            if (segmentIdx == nSegments)\n            {\n                ranges.Add(new Tuple&lt;string, string, int&gt;(start, "*", count + productsRemaining));\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        return ranges;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>Filter results by selected facet</h1> \n\n<p>Fourth, suppose ("250","500",38) was one of the resulting segments.  If the user selects "$250 to $500" as a filter, simply do a filter query <code>fq=price:[250 TO 500]</code></p>\n', 'questionId': '33956', 'answerId': '11329853'}

{'answer': '<p>I came here because I also ran into this question in <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1934356344">The Passionate Programmer</a>, by Chad Fowler. For those who don\'t have access to a copy, the question is framed as a kind of filter/test for candidates interviewing for a position requiring "really good Java programmers."</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, he asks:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How would you write a program, in pure Java, that would cause the Java Virtual Machine to crash?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I\'ve programmed in Java for over 15 years, and I found this question to be both puzzling and unfair. As others have pointed out, Java, as a managed language, is specifically designed <em>not to crash</em>. Of course there are always JVM bugs, but:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>After 15+ years of production-level JREs, it\'s rare.</li>\n<li>Any such bugs are likely to be patched in the next release, so how likely are you as a programmer to run into and recall the details of the current set of JRE show-stoppers?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As others have mentioned, some native code via JNI is a sure way to crash a JRE. But the author specifically mentioned <em>in pure Java</em>, so that\'s out.</p>\n\n<p>Another option would be to feed the JRE bogus byte codes; it\'s easy enough to dump some garbage binary data to a .class file, and ask the JRE to run it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ echo \'crap crap crap\' &gt; crap.class\n$ java crap\nException in thread "main" java.lang.ClassFormatError: Incompatible magic value 1668440432 in class file crap\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Does that count? I mean the JRE itself hasn\'t crashed; it properly detected the bogus code, reported it, and exited. </p>\n\n<p>This leaves us with the most obvious kinds of solutions such as blowing the stack via recursion, running out of heap memory via object allocations, or simply throwing <code>RuntimeException</code>. But this just causes the JRE to exit with a <code>StackOverflowError</code> or similar exception, which, again <em>is not really a crash</em>.</p>\n\n<p>So what\'s left? I\'d really love to hear what the author really had in mind as a proper solution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: Chad Fowler <a href="https://twitter.com/chadfowler/status/227845163031072768">responded here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>PS: it\'s an otherwise great book.

Annotation is a mechanism for tagging classes with metadata so that, they can be used by metadata-aware programs. Generics is a mechanism of specifying types for objects belonging to collections, such as Arraylists, so that type safety is guaranteed at compile time.

{'answer': '<p>Actually, the question of throwing IllegalArgumentException or NullPointerException is in my humble view only a "holy war" for a minority with an incomlete understanding of exception handling in Java. In general, the rules are simple, and as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>argument constraint violations must be indicated as fast as possible (-> fast fail), in order to avoid illegal states which are much harder to debug</li>\n<li>in case of an invalid null pointer for whatever reason, throw NullPointerException</li>\n<li>in case of an illegal array/collection index, throw ArrayIndexOutOfBounds</li>\n<li>in case of a negative array/collection size, throw NegativeArraySizeException</li>\n<li>in case of an illegal argument that is not covered by the above, and for which you don\'t have another more specific exception type, throw IllegalArgumentException as a wastebasket</li>\n<li>on the other hand, in case of a constraint violation WITHIN A FIELD that could not be avoided by fast fail for some valid reason, catch and rethrow as IllegalStateException or a more specific checked exception. Never let pass the original NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBounds, etc in this case!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are at least three very good reasons against the case of mapping all kinds of argument constraint violations to IllegalArgumentException, with the third probably being so severe as to mark the practice bad style:</p>\n\n<p>(1) A programmer cannot a safely assume that all cases of argument constraint violations result in IllegalArgumentException, because the large majority of standard classes use this exception rather as a wastebasket if there is no more specific kind of exception available. Trying to map all cases of argument constraint violations to IllegalArgumentException in your API only leads to programmer frustration using your classes, as the standard libraries mostly follow different rules that violate yours, and most of your API users will use them as well!</p>\n\n<p>(2) Mapping the exceptions actually results in a different kind of anomaly, caused by single inheritance: All Java exceptions are classes, and therefore support single inheritance only. Therefore, there is no way to create an exception that is truly say both a NullPointerException and an IllegalArgumentException, as subclasses can only inherit from one or the other. Throwing an IllegalArgumentException in case of a null argument therefore makes it harder for API users to distinguish between problems whenever a program tries to programmatically correct the problem, for example by feeding default values into a call repeat!</p>\n\n<p>(3) Mapping actually creates the danger of bug masking: In order to map argument constraint violations into IllegalArgumentException, you\'ll need to code an outer try-catch within every method that has any constrained arguments. However, simply catching RuntimeException in this catch block is out of the question, because that risks mapping documented RuntimeExceptions thrown by libery methods used within yours into IllegalArgumentException, even if they are no caused by argument constraint violations. So you need to be very specific, but even that effort doesn\'t protect you from the case that you accidentally map an undocumented runtime exception of another API (i.e. a bug) into an IllegalArgumentException of your API. Even the most careful mapping therefore risks masking programming errors of other library makers as argument constraint violations of your method\'s users, which is simply hillareous behavior!</p>\n\n<p>With the standard practice on the other hand, the rules stay simple, and exception causes stay unmasked and specific. For the method caller, the rules are easy as well:\n- if you encounter a documented runtime exception of any kind because you passed an illegal value, either repeat the call with a default (for this specific exceptions are neccessary), or correct your code\n- if on the other hand you enccounter a runtime exception that is not documented to happen for a given set of arguments, file a bug report to the method\'s makers to ensure that either their code or their documentation is fixed.</p>\n', 'questionId': '3881', 'answerId': '14104551'}

{'answer': "<p>The CLR and JVM have goals and philosophies that differ more than you might think. In general, the JVM aims to optimize more dynamic, higher-level code while the CLR gives you more low-level tools to do these kinds of optimizations yourself. </p>\n\n<p>A good example is stack allocation. On the CLR you have explicit stack allocation of custom value types. On the JVM the only custom types are reference types but the JVM can convert heap allocations to stack allocations in certain circumstances through Escape Analysis.</p>\n\n<p>Another example. In Java, methods are virtual by default. On C# at least, they are not. It is much more difficult to optimize virtual method calls because the code that gets executed at a given call site cannot be determined statically.</p>\n\n<p>Under the hood, their execution systems are quite different. Most JVMs (in particular, Hotspot) start out with a bytecode interpreter and only JIT-compile parts of the code that are executed heavily e.g. tight loops. They can also re-compile these over and over each time using execution statistics collected from previous runs to drive optimizations. This allows more optimization effort to be applied to the parts of the program that need it most. This is called adaptive optimization.</p>\n\n<p>The CLR compiles everything up-front only once. It does fewer optimization both because it has more code to compile and so has to be fast and because it doesn't have any statistics of the actual execution paths taken to feed into its optimizations. This approach does have the very significant advantage of allowing you to cache compilation results across processes, which CLR does but JVM does not.</p>\n\n<p>A large percentage of the Hotspot JVM code is dedicated to these adaptive optimizations and they are what put Java in the same performance ballpark as native code for most general purpose computation in the early 2000s. They are also what makes the JVM a decent target for dynamic languages.

{'answer': "<p>I use <code>static final</code> to declare constants and go with the ALL_CAPS naming notation. I have seen quite a few real life instances where all constants are bunched together into an interface. A few posts have rightly called that a bad practice, primarily because that's not what an interface is for. An interface should enforce a contract and should not be a place to put unrelated constants in. Putting it together into a class that cannot be instantiated (through a private constructor) too is fine if the constant semantics don't belong to a specific class(es). I always put a constant in the class that it's most related to, because that makes sense and is also easily maintainable.</p>\n\n<p>Enums are a good choice to represent a range of values, but if you are storing standalone constants with an emphasis on the absolute value (eg.

On one had you would like to compare two test frameworks, on the other hand you would like to implement tests easily, have natural assertions, etc...</p>\n\n<p>Ok, firstly JUnit has been playing catchup with TestNG in terms of functionality, they have bridged the gap some what with v4, but not well enough in my opinion. Things like annotations and dataproviders are still much better in TestNG. Also they are more flexible in terms of test execution, since TestNG has test dependency, grouping and ordering.</p>\n\n<p>JUnit still requires certain before/after methods to be static, which limits what you can do prior to the running of tests, TestNG never has this issue.</p>\n\n<p>TBH, mostly the differences between the two frameworks don\'t mean much, unless your focusing on integration/automation testing. JUnit from my experience is built from the ground up for unit testing and is now being pushed towards higher levels of testing, which IMO makes it the wrong tool for the job. TestNG does well at unit testing and due to its robust dataproviding and great test execution abilities, works even better at integration/automation test level.</p>\n\n<p>Now for what I believe is a separate issue, how to write well structured, readable and maintainable tests. Most of this I am sure you know, but things like <strong>Factory Pattern</strong>, <strong>Command Pattern</strong> and <strong>PageObjects</strong> (if your testing websites) are vital, it is very important to have a layer of abstraction between what your testing (SUT) and what the actual test is (assertions of business logic).

The difference lies in what happens once A releases the monitor. If you used notify(), then B and C are still blocked in wait(): they are not waiting on the monitor, they are waiting to be notified. When A releases the monitor, B and C will still be sitting there, waiting for a notify().</p>\n\n<p>If you used notifyAll(), then B and C have both advanced past the "wait for notification" state and are both waiting to acquire the monitor.

{'answer': '<p>In an attempt to add even more to this, I thought I\'d include the SCJP Study Guide section on the topic. This is from the guide that is made to pass the Sun/Oracle test on the behaviour of Java so it\'s a good source to use for this discussion.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Passing Variables into Methods (Objective 7.3)</p>\n  \n  <p>7.3 Determine the effect upon object references and primitive values when they are passed into methods that perform assignments or other modifying operations on the parameters.</p>\n  \n  <p>Methods can be declared to take primitives and/or object references. You need to know how (or if) the caller\'s variable can be affected by the called method. The difference between object reference and primitive variables, when passed into methods, is huge and important. To understand this section, you\'ll need to be comfortable with the assignments section covered in the first part of this chapter.</p>\n  \n  <p>Passing Object Reference Variables</p>\n  \n  <p>When you pass an object variable into a method, you must keep in mind that you\'re passing the object reference, and not the actual object itself. Remember that a reference variable holds bits that represent (to the underlying VM) a way to get to a specific object in memory (on the heap). More importantly, you must remember that you aren\'t even passing the actual reference variable, but rather a copy of the reference variable. A copy of a variable means you get a copy of the bits in that variable, so when you pass a reference variable, you\'re passing a copy of the bits representing how to get to a specific object. In other words, both the caller and the called method will now have identical copies of the reference, and thus both will refer to the same exact (not a copy) object on the heap.</p>\n  \n  <p>For this example, we\'ll use the Dimension class from the java.awt package:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>1. import java.awt.Dimension;\n2. class ReferenceTest {\n3.     public static void main (String [] args) {\n4.

System.out.println("After modify() d.height = "\n9.     }\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.   }\n14. }\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When we run this class, we can see that the modify() method was indeed able to modify the original (and only) Dimension object created on line 4.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre>\nC:\\Java Projects\\Reference>java ReferenceTest\nBefore modify() d.height = 10\ndim = 11\nAfter modify() d.height = 11\n</pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Notice when the Dimension object on line 4 is passed to the modify() method, any changes to the object that occur inside the method are being made to the object whose reference was passed. In the preceding example, reference variables d and dim both point to the same object.</p>\n  \n  <p>Does Java Use Pass-By-Value Semantics?</p>\n  \n  <p>If Java passes objects by passing the reference variable instead, does that mean Java uses pass-by-reference for objects? Not exactly, although you\'ll often hear and read that it does. Java is actually pass-by-value for all variables running within a single VM. Pass-by-value means pass-by-variable-value. And that means, pass-by-copy-of- the-variable! (There\'s that word copy again!)</p>\n  \n  <p>It makes no difference if you\'re passing primitive or reference variables, you are always passing a copy of the bits in the variable. So for a primitive variable, you\'re passing a copy of the bits representing the value. For example, if you pass an int variable with the value of 3, you\'re passing a copy of the bits representing 3. The called method then gets its own copy of the value, to do with it what it likes.</p>\n  \n  <p>And if you\'re passing an object reference variable, you\'re passing a copy of the bits representing the reference to an object. The called method then gets its own copy of the reference variable, to do with it what it likes. But because two identical reference variables refer to the exact same object, if the called method modifies the object (by invoking setter methods, for example), the caller will see that the object the caller\'s original variable refers to has also been changed. In the next section, we\'ll look at how the picture changes when we\'re talking about primitives.</p>\n  \n  <p>The bottom line on pass-by-value: the called method can\'t change the caller\'s variable, although for object reference variables, the called method can change the object the variable referred to. What\'s the difference between changing the variable and changing the object? For object references, it means the called method can\'t reassign the caller\'s original reference variable and make it refer to a different object, or null. For example, in the following code fragment,</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>        void bar() {\n           Foo f = new Foo();\n           doStuff(f);\n        }\n        void doStuff(Foo g) {\n           g.setName("Boo");\n           g = new Foo();\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>reassigning g does not reassign f! At the end of the bar() method, two Foo objects have been created, one referenced by the local variable f and one referenced by\n  the local (argument) variable g. Because the doStuff() method has a copy of the reference variable, it has a way to get to the original Foo object, for instance to call the setName() method. But, the doStuff() method does not have a way to get to the f reference variable. So doStuff() can change values within the object f refers to, but doStuff() can\'t change the actual contents (bit pattern) of f. In other words, doStuff() can change the state of the object that f refers to, but it can\'t make f refer to a different object!</p>\n  \n  <p>Passing Primitive Variables</p>\n  \n  <p>Let\'s look at what happens when a primitive variable is passed to a method:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>class ReferenceTest {\n    public static void main (String [] args) {\n      int a = 1;\n      ReferenceTest rt = new ReferenceTest();\n      System.out.println("Before modify() a = " + a);\n      rt.modify(a);\n      System.out.println("After modify() a = " + a);\n    }\n    void modify(int number) {\n      number = number + 1;\n      System.out.println("number = " + number);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In this simple program, the variable a is passed to a method called modify(),\n  which increments the variable by 1. The resulting output looks like this:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>  Before modify() a = 1\n  number = 2\n  After modify() a = 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Notice that a did not change after it was passed to the method. Remember, it was a copy of a that was passed to the method. When a primitive variable is passed to a method, it is passed by value, which means pass-by-copy-of-the-bits-in-the-variable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n', 'questionId': '40480', 'answerId': '17303467'}

If we use standards and well known architectures, we can be sure that our code will be easy to maintain by other developers that come after us, and I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t want to deal with the task of fixing a code that didn\u2019t applied any known methodology as it would be very hard to understand it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The interface segregation principle.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Know that we know what the SOLID principles are we can get into more detail about the Interface Segregation principle, but what exactly does the interface segregation says?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\u201cClients should not be forced to implement unnecessary methods which\n  they will not use\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This means that sometimes we tend to make interfaces with a lot of methods, which can be good to an extent, however this can easily abused, and we can end up with classes that implement empty or useless methods which of course adds extra code and burden to our apps.\nImagine you are declaring a lot of methods in single interface, if you like visual aids a class that is implementing an interface but that is really needing a couple of methods of it would look like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V6p8i.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>\n\n<p>In the other hand, if you properly apply the interface segregation and split your interface in smaller subsets you can me sure to implement those that are only needed:</p>\n\n<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M0eWu.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>\n\n<p>See! Is way better!  Enforcing this principle will allow you to have low coupling which aids to  a better maintainability and high  resistance to changes. So you can really leverage the usage of interfaces and implementing the methods when you really should.\nNow let\u2019s review a less abstract example, say you declared an interface called Reportable</p>\n\n<pre><code>public interface Reportable {\n\n        void printPDF();\n        void printWord();\n        void printExcel();\n        void printPPT();\n        void printHTML();\n\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And you have a client that will only to export some data in Excel format, you can implement the interface, but would you only have to implement the excel method? The answer is no, you will have to code the implementation for all the methods even if you are not going to use them, this can cause a lot of junk code hence making the code hard to maintain..</p>\n\n<p><strong>Remember keep it simple and don\u2019t repeat yourself and you will find that you are already using this principle without knowing.</strong></p>\n', 'questionId': '58988', 'answerId': '17999321'}

Here\'s some additional information that will hopefully aid in understanding what\'s happening in memory.</p>\n\n<p>Crash course on stack/heap before we get to the Java implementation:\nValues go on and off the stack in a nice orderly fashion, like a stack of plates at a cafeteria.\nMemory in the heap (also known as dynamic memory) is haphazard and disorganized. The JVM just finds space wherever it can, and frees it up as the variables that use it are no longer needed.</p>\n\n<p>Okay. First off, local primitives go on the stack. So this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int x = 3;\nfloat y = 101.1f;\nboolean amIAwesome = true;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>results in this:</p>\n\n<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7nGKU.png" alt="primitives on the stack"></p>\n\n<p>When you declare and instantiate an object. The actual object goes on the heap. What goes on the stack? The address of the object on the heap. C++ programmers would call this a pointer, but some Java developers are racist against the word "pointer". Whatever. Just know that the address of the object goes in the stack.</p>\n\n<p>Like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int problems = 99;\nString name = "Jay-Z";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yTIYp.png" alt="a b*7ch aint one!"></p>\n\n<p>An array is an object, so it goes on the heap as well. And what about the objects in the array? They get their own heap space, and the address of each object goes inside the array.</p>\n\n<pre><code>JButton[] marxBros = new JButton[3];\nmarxBros[0] = new JButton("Groucho");\nmarxBros[1] = new JButton("Zeppo");\nmarxBros[2] = new JButton("Harpo");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v2b33.png" alt="marx brothers"></p>\n\n<p>So, what gets passed in when you call a method? If you pass in an object, what you\'re actually passing in is the address of the object. Some might say the "value" of the address, and some say it\'s just a reference to the object. This is the genesis of the holy war between "reference" and "value" proponents. What you call it isn\'t as important as that you understand that what\'s getting passed in is the address to the object.</p>\n\n<pre><code>private static void shout(String name){\n    System.out.println("There goes " + name + "!");\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args){\n    String hisName = "John J. Jingleheimerschmitz";\n    String myName = hisName;\n    shout(myName);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>One String gets created and space for it is allocated in the heap, and the address to the string is stored on the stack and given the identifier <code>hisName</code>, since the address of the second String is the same as the first, no new String is created and no new heap space is allocated, but a new identifier is created on the stack. Then we call <code>shout()</code>: a new stack frame is created and a new identifier, <code>name</code> is created and assigned the address of the already-existing String.</p>\n\n<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q0prc.png" alt="la da di da da da da"></p>\n\n<p>So, value, reference?

{'answer': "<p>Checked Exceptions are great, so long as you understand when they should be used. The Java core API fails to follow these rules for SQLException (and sometimes for IOException) which is why they are so terrible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Checked Exceptions</strong> should be used for <strong>expected</strong>, but <strong>unpreventable</strong> errors that are <strong>reasonable to recover from</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Unchecked Exceptions</strong> should be used for everything else.</p>\n\n<p>I'll break this down for you, because most people misunderstand what this means.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Expected but unpreventable</strong>: The caller did everything within their power to validate the input parameters, but some condition outside their control has caused the operation to fail. For example, you try reading a file but someone deletes it between the time you check if it exists and the time the read operation begins. By declaring a checked exception, you are telling the caller to anticipate this failure.</li>\n<li><strong>Reasonable to recover from</strong>: There is no point telling callers to anticipate exceptions that they cannot recover from. If a user attempts to read from an non-existing file, the caller can prompt them for a new filename. On the other hand, if the method fails due to a programming bug (invalid method arguments or buggy method implementation) there is nothing the application can do to fix the problem in mid-execution. The best it can do is log the problem and wait for the developer to fix it at a later time.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Unless the exception you are throwing meets <strong>all</strong> of the above conditions it should use an Unchecked Exception.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reevaluate at every level</strong>: Sometimes the method catching the checked exception isn't the right place to handle the error. In that case, consider what is reasonable for your own callers. If the exception is expected, unpreventable and reasonable for them to recover from then you should throw a checked exception yourself. If not, you should wrap the exception in an unchecked exception. If you follow this rule you will find yourself converting checked exceptions to unchecked exceptions and vice versa depending on what layer you are in.</p>\n\n<p>For both checked and unchecked exceptions, <strong>use the right abstraction level</strong>. For example, a code repository with two different implementations (database and filesystem) should avoid exposing implementation-specific details by throwing <code>SQLException</code> or <code>IOException</code>. Instead, it should wrap the exception in an abstraction that spans all implementations (e.g. <code>RepositoryException</code>).</p>\n", 'questionId': '27578', 'answerId': '19061110'}

{'answer': '<h2>A reference is always a value when represented, no matter what language you use.</h2>\n\n<p>Getting an outside of the box view, let\'s look at Assembly or some low level memory management. At the CPU level a <em>reference</em> to anything immediately becomes a <em>value</em> if it gets written to memory or to one of the CPU registers. (That is why <em>pointer</em> is a good definition. It is a value, which has a purpose at the same time).</p>\n\n<p>Data in memory has a <strong>Location</strong> and at that location there is a value (byte,word, whatever). In Assembly we have a convenient solution to give a <strong>Name</strong> to certain <strong>Location</strong> (aka variable), but when compiling the code, the assembler simply replaces <strong>Name</strong> with the designated location just like your browser replaces domain names with IP addresses.</p>\n\n<p>Down to the core it is technically impossible to pass a reference to anything in any language without representing it (when it immediately becomes a value).</p>\n\n<p>Lets say we have a variable Foo, its <strong>Location</strong> is at the 47th byte in memory and its <strong>Value</strong> is 5. We have another variable <strong>Ref2Foo</strong> which is at 223rd byte in memory, and its value will be 47. This Ref2Foo might be a technical variable, not explicitly created by the program. If you just look at 5 and 47 without any other information, you will see just two <strong>Values</strong>.\nIf you use them as references then to reach to <code>5</code> we have to travel:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(Name)[Location] -&gt; [Value at the Location]\n---------------------\n(Ref2Foo)[223]  -&gt; 47\n(Foo)[47]       -&gt; 5\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is how jump-tables work. </p>\n\n<p>If we want to call a method/function/procedure with Foo\'s value, there are a few possible way to pass the variable to the method, depending on the <strong>language</strong> and its several method invocation modes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>5 gets copied to one of the CPU registers (ie. EAX).</li>\n<li>5 gets PUSHd to the stack.</li>\n<li>47 gets copied to one of the CPU registers</li>\n<li>47 PUSHd to the stack.</li>\n<li>223 gets copied to one of the CPU registers.</li>\n<li>223 gets PUSHd to the stack.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In every cases above a value - a <strong>copy</strong> of an existing value - has been created, it is now upto the receiving method to handle it. When you write "Foo" inside the method, it is either read out from EAX, or automatically  <strong>dereferenced</strong>, or double dereferenced, the process depends on how the language works and/or what the type of Foo dictates. This is hidden from the developer until she circumvents the dereferencing process. So a <em>reference</em> is a <em>value</em> when represented, because a reference is a value that has to be processed (at language level).</p>\n\n<p>Now we have passed Foo to the method:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>in case 1. and 2. if you change Foo (<code>Foo = 9</code>) it only affects local scope as you have a copy of the Value. From inside the method we cannot even determine where in memory the original Foo was located.</li>\n<li>in case 3. and 4. if you use default language constructs and change Foo (<code>Foo = 11</code>), it could change Foo globally (depends on the language, ie. Java or like Pascal\'s <code>procedure findMin(x, y, z: integer;</code><strong>var m</strong><code>: integer);</code>). However if the language allows you to circumvent the dereference process, you can change <code>47</code>, say to <code>49</code>. At that point Foo seems to have been changed if you read it, because you have changed the <strong>local pointer</strong> to it. And if you were to modify this Foo inside the method (<code>Foo = 12</code>) you will probably FUBAR the execution of the program (aka. segfault) because you will write to a different memory than expected, you can even modify an area that is destined to hold executable program and writing to it will modify running code (Foo is now not at <code>47</code>). BUT Foo\'s value of <code>47</code> did not change globally, only the one inside the method, because <code>47</code> was also a copy to the method.</li>\n<li>in case 5. and 6. if you modify <code>223</code> inside the method it creates the same mayhem as in 3. or 4. (a pointer, pointing to a now bad value, that is again used as a pointer) but this is still a local problem, as 223 was <strong>copied</strong>. However if you are able to dereference <code>Ref2Foo</code> (that is <code>223</code>), reach to and modify the pointed value <code>47</code>, say, to <code>49</code>, it will affect Foo <strong>globally</strong>, because in this case the methods got a copy of <code>223</code>  but the referenced <code>47</code> exists only once, and changing that to <code>49</code> will lead every <code>Ref2Foo</code> double-dereferencing to a wrong value.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Nitpicking on insignificant details, even languages that do pass-by-reference will pass values to functions, but those functions know that they have to use it for dereferencing purposes. This pass-the-reference-as-value is just hidden from the programmer because it is practically useless and the terminology is only <em>pass-by-reference</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Strict <em>pass-by-value</em> is also useless, it would mean that a 100 Mbyte array should have to be copied every time we call a method with the array as argument, therefore Java cannot be stricly pass-by-value. Every language would pass a reference to this huge array (as a value) and either employs copy-on-write mechanism if that array can be changed locally inside the method or allows the method (as Java does) to modify the array globally (from the caller\'s view) and a few languages allows to modify the Value of the reference itself.</p>\n\n<p>So in short and in Java\'s own terminology, Java is <em>pass-by-value</em> where <em>value</em> can be: either a <strong>real value</strong> or a <strong>value</strong> that is a representation of a <strong>reference</strong>. </p>\n', 'questionId': '40480', 'answerId': '20566453'}

{'answer': '<p>One must understand the Garbage Collector(GC) Workflow to understand the function of finalize. calling .finalize() will not invoke the garbage collector, nor calling system.gc. Actually, What finalize will help the coder is to declare the reference of the object as "unreferenced".</p>\n\n<p>GC forces a suspension on the running operation of JVM, which creates a dent on the performance. During operation, GC will traverse all referenced objects, starting from the root object(your main method call). This suspension time can be decreased by declaring the objects as unreferenced manually, because it will cut down the operation costs to declare the object reference obsolete by the automated run. By declaring finalize(), coder sets the reference to the object obsolete, thus on the next run of GC operation, GC run will sweep the objects without using operation time.</p>\n\n<p>Quote: "After the finalize method has been invoked for an object, no further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, including possible actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized, at which point the object may be discarded.

If Java were to autobox primitives that were dereferenced, people might assume that it was mapping the dereferencing syntax to static method calls (which is effectively what happens in .NET), and thus that operations written in that form were no more costly than would be the equivalent static method invocations.  Adding a new language feature that would encourage people to write bad code (e.g. auto-boxing dereferenced primitives) doesn't seem like a good idea, though allowing dereferencing-style methods might be.</p>\n", 'questionId': '4242', 'answerId': '21469629'}

JUnit still requires the before/after class methods to be static, which limits\n    what you can do prior to the running of tests, TestNG never has this issue.\n\n2.  TestNG @Configuration methods can all take an optional argument to their \n    annotated methods in the form of a ITestResult, XmlTest, Method, or \n    ITestContext.  This allows you to pass things around that JUnit wouldn't \n    provide you.  JUnit only does this in listeners and it is limited in use.\n\n3.  TestNG comes with some pre-made report generation classes that you can copy\n     and edit and make into your own beautiful test output with very little \n     effort. Just copy the report class into your project and add a listener \n     to run it.  Also, ReportNG is available.\n\n4.

{'answer': u'<p>Here is a very simple solution to your Checked/Unchecked dilemma.</p>\n\n<p>Rule 1: Think of a Unchecked Exception as a testable condition before code executes.\nfor example\u2026</p>\n\n<pre><code>x.doSomething(); // the code throws a NullPointerException\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where x is null...\n\u2026the code should possibly have the following\u2026</p>\n\n<pre><code>if (x==null)\n{\n    //do something below to make sure when x.doSomething() is executed, it won\u2019t throw a NullPointerException.\n    x = new X();\n}\nx.doSomething();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Rule 2: Think of a Checked Exception as an un-testable condition that may occur while the code executes.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Socket s = new Socket(\u201cgoogle.com\u201d, 80);\nInputStream in = s.getInputStream();\nOutputStream out = s.getOutputStream();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>\u2026in the example above, the URL (google.com) may be unavailable to due the DNS server being down. Even at the instant the DNS server was working and resolved the \u2018google.com\u2019 name to an IP address, if the connection is made to google.com, at anytime afterword, the network could go down. You simply can not test the network all the time before reading and writing to streams.</p>\n\n<p>There are times where the code simply must execute before we can know if there is a problem. By forcing developers to write their code in such a way to force them to handle these situations via Checked Exception, I have to tip my hat to the creator of Java that invented this concept.</p>\n\n<p>In general, almost all the APIs in Java follow the 2 rules above. If you try to write to a file, the disk could fill up before completing the write. It is possible that other processes had caused the disk to become full. There is simply no way to test for this situation. For those who interact with hardware where at any time, using the hardware can fail, Checked Exceptions seem to be an elegant solution to this problem.</p>\n\n<p>There is a gray area to this. In the event that many tests are needed (a mind blowing if statement with lots of &amp;&amp; and ||), the exception thrown will be a CheckedException simply because it\u2019s too much of a pain to get right \u2014 you simply can\u2019t say this problem is a programming error. If there are much less than 10 tests (e.g. \u2018if (x == null)\u2019), then the programmer error should be a UncheckedException.</p>\n\n<p>Things get interesting when dealing with language interpreters. According to the rules above, should a Syntax Error be considered a Checked or Unchecked Exception? I would argue that if the syntax of the language can be tested before it gets executed, it should be an UncheckedException. If the language can not be tested \u2014 similar to how assembly code runs on a personal computer, then the Syntax Error should be a Checked Exception.</p>\n\n<p>The 2 rules above will probably remove 90% of your concern over which to choose from. To summarize the rules, follow this pattern\u2026\n1) if the code to be execute can be tested before it\u2019s executed for it to run correctly and if an Exception occurs \u2014 a.k.a. a programmer error, the Exception should be an UncheckedException (a subclass of RuntimeException).\n2) if the code to be executed can not be tested before it\u2019s executed for it to run correctly, the Exception should be a Checked Exception (a subclass of Exception).</p>\n', 'questionId': '27578', 'answerId': '23439719'}

{'answer': u'<p>I thought I\'d contribute this answer to add more details from the Specifications.</p>\n\n<p>First, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/373419/whats-the-difference-between-passing-by-reference-vs-passing-by-value">What&#39;s the difference between passing by reference vs. passing by value?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Passing by reference means the called functions\' parameter will be the\n  same as the callers\' passed argument (not the value, but the identity\n  - the variable itself). </p>\n  \n  <p>Pass by value means the called functions\' parameter will be a copy of\n  the callers\' passed argument.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Or from wikipedia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_by_reference#Call_by_reference" rel="nofollow noreferrer">on the subject of pass-by-reference</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In call-by-reference evaluation (also referred to as\n  pass-by-reference), a function receives an implicit reference to a\n  variable used as argument, rather than a copy of its value. This\n  typically means that the function can modify (i.e. assign to) the\n  variable used as argument\u2014something that will be seen by its caller.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_by_value#Call_by_value" rel="nofollow noreferrer">on the subject of pass-by-value</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In call-by-value, the argument expression is evaluated, and the\n  resulting value is bound to the corresponding variable in the function [...]. \n  If the function or procedure is able to assign values to its\n  parameters, only its local copy is assigned [...].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Second, we need to know what Java uses in its method invocations. The <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.4.1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Java Language Specification</a> states</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When the method or constructor is invoked (\xa715.12), <strong>the values of the\n  actual argument expressions initialize newly created parameter\n  variables</strong>, each of the declared type, before execution of the body of\n  the method or constructor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it assigns (or binds) the value of the argument to the corresponding parameter variable. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the value of the argument?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let\'s consider reference types, the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Java Virtual Machine Specification</a> states</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are three kinds of <strong>reference types</strong>: class types, array types,\n  and interface types. <strong>Their values are references to dynamically\n  created class instances, arrays, or class instances or arrays that\n  implement interfaces, respectively.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.3.1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Java Language Specification</a> also states</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>The reference values (often just references) are pointers to these objects</strong>, and a special null reference, which refers to no object.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The value of an argument (of some reference type) is a pointer to an object. Note that a variable, an invocation of a method with a reference type return type, and an instance creation expression (<code>new ...</code>) all resolve to a reference type value.</p>\n\n<p>So</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void method (String param) {}\n...\nString var = new String("ref");\nmethod(var);\nmethod(var.toString());\nmethod(new String("ref"));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>all bind the value of a reference to a <code>String</code> instance to the method\'s newly created parameter, <code>param</code>. This is exactly what the definition of pass-by-value describes. As such, <strong>Java is pass-by-value</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The fact that you can follow the reference to invoke a method or access a field of the referenced object is completely irrelevant to the conversation.</strong> The definition of pass-by-reference was</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This typically means that the function can modify (i.e. assign to) the\n  variable used as argument\u2014something that will be seen by its caller.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Java, modifying the variable means reassigning it. In Java, if you reassigned the variable within the method, it would go unnoticed to the caller. <strong>Modifying the object referenced by the variable is a different concept entirely.</strong> </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Primitive values are also defined in the Java Virtual Machine Specification, <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.3" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. The value of the type is the corresponding integral or floating point value, encoded appropriately (8, 16, 32, 64, etc. bits).</p>\n', 'questionId': '40480', 'answerId': '24546764'}

As of the Java 2 platform v1.2, Hashtable class\n  was retrofitted to implement the Map interface, making it a member of\n  the Java Collections Framework.</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>One of the major differences between HashMap and Hashtable is that HashMap is non-synchronized whereas Hashtable is synchronized, which\n  means Hashtable is thread-safe and can be shared between multiple\n  threads but HashMap cannot be shared between multiple threads without\n  proper synchronization. Java 5 introduced ConcurrentHashMap which is\n  an alternative of Hashtable and provides better scalability than\n  Hashtable in Java.Synchronized means only one thread can modify a hash\n  table at one point of time. Basically, it means that any thread before\n  performing an update on a hashtable will have to acquire a lock on the\n  object while others will wait for lock to be released.</p></li>\n  <li><p>The HashMap class is roughly equivalent to Hashtable, except that it permits nulls. (HashMap allows null values as key and value whereas\n  Hashtable doesn\u2019t allow nulls).</p></li>\n  <li><p>The third significant difference between HashMap vs Hashtable is that Iterator in the HashMap is a fail-fast iterator while the\n  enumerator for the Hashtable is not and throw\n  ConcurrentModificationException if any other Thread modifies the map\n  structurally by adding or removing any element except Iterator\u2019s own\n  remove() method. But this is not a guaranteed behavior and will be\n  done by JVM on best effort. This is also an important difference\n  between Enumeration and Iterator in Java.</p></li>\n  <li><p>One more notable difference between Hashtable and HashMap is that because of thread-safety and synchronization Hashtable is much slower\n  than HashMap if used in Single threaded environment. So if you don\u2019t\n  need synchronization and HashMap is only used by one thread, it out\n  perform Hashtable in Java.</p></li>\n  <li><p>HashMap does not guarantee that the order of the map will remain constant over time.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>Note that HashMap can be synchronized by</p>\n\n<pre><code>Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(hashMap);\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>In Summary there are significant differences between Hashtable and\n  HashMap in Java e.g. thread-safety and speed and based upon that only\n  use Hashtable if you absolutely need thread-safety, if you are running\n  Java 5 consider using ConcurrentHashMap in Java.</p>\n</blockquote>\n', 'questionId': '40471', 'answerId': '25348157'}

{'answer': '<p><strong>Uses of Reflection</strong></p>\n\n<p>Reflection is commonly used by programs which require the ability to examine or modify the runtime behavior of applications running in the Java virtual machine. This is a relatively advanced feature and should be used only by developers who have a strong grasp of the fundamentals of the language. With that caveat in mind, reflection is a powerful technique and can enable applications to perform operations which would otherwise be impossible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Extensibility Features</strong></p>\n\n<p>An application may make use of external, user-defined classes by creating instances of extensibility objects using their fully-qualified names.\nClass Browsers and Visual Development Environments\nA class browser needs to be able to enumerate the members of classes. Visual development environments can benefit from making use of type information available in reflection to aid the developer in writing correct code.\nDebuggers and Test Tools\nDebuggers need to be able to examine private members on classes. Test harnesses can make use of reflection to systematically call a discoverable set APIs defined on a class, to insure a high level of code coverage in a test suite.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Drawbacks of Reflection</strong></p>\n\n<p>Reflection is powerful, but should not be used indiscriminately. If it is possible to perform an operation without using reflection, then it is preferable to avoid using it. The following concerns should be kept in mind when accessing code via reflection.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Performance Overhead</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Because reflection involves types that are dynamically resolved, certain Java virtual machine optimizations can not be performed. Consequently, reflective operations have slower performance than their non-reflective counterparts, and should be avoided in sections of code which are called frequently in performance-sensitive applications.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Security Restrictions</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Reflection requires a runtime permission which may not be present when running under a security manager. This is in an important consideration for code which has to run in a restricted security context, such as in an Applet.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exposure of Internals</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Since reflection allows code to perform operations that would be illegal in non-reflective code, such as accessing private fields and methods, the use of reflection can result in unexpected side-effects, which may render code dysfunctional and may destroy portability. Reflective code breaks abstractions and therefore may change behavior with upgrades of the platform.</p>\n\n<p>source: <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/" rel="noreferrer">The Reflection API</a></p>\n', 'questionId': '37628', 'answerId': '26424561'}

{'answer': '<p>If you have control over the XML format, you should turn the problem inside out. Rather than attaching the binary XML you should think about how to enclose a document that has multiple parts, one of which contains XML.</p>\n\n<p>The traditional solution to this is an archive (e.g. tar). But if you want to keep your enclosing document in a text-based format or if you don\'t have access to an file archiving library, there is also a standardized scheme that is used heavily in email and HTTP which is <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2387" rel="nofollow">multipart/* MIME</a> with <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3030" rel="nofollow">Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary</a>. </p>\n\n<p>For example if your servers communicate through HTTP and you want to send a multipart document, the primary being an XML document which refers to a binary data, the HTTP communication might look something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>POST / HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: multipart/related; boundary="qd43hdi34udh34id344"\n... other headers elided ...\n\n--qd43hdi34udh34id344\nContent-Type: application/xml\n\n&lt;myxml&gt;\n    &lt;data href="cid:data.bin"/&gt;\n&lt;/myxml&gt;\n--qd43hdi34udh34id344\nContent-Id: &lt;data.bin&gt;\nContent-type: application/octet-stream\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: binary\n\n... binary data ...\n--qd43hdi34udh34id344--\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As in above example, the XML refer to the binary data in the enclosing multipart by using a <code>cid</code> URI scheme which is an identifier to the Content-Id header. The overhead of this scheme would be just the MIME header. A similar scheme can also be used for HTTP response. Of course in HTTP protocol, you also have the option of sending a multipart document into separate request/response.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to avoid wrapping your data in a multipart is to use data URI:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;myxml&gt;\n    &lt;data href="data:application/something;charset=utf-8;base64,dGVzdGRhdGE="/&gt;\n&lt;/myxml&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But this has the base64 overhead.</p>\n', 'questionId': '19893', 'answerId': '27396540'}

HashMap is non synchronized and not thread safe.On the other hand, HashTable is thread safe and synchronized.\nWhen to use HashMap ?  answer is if your application do not require any multi-threading task, in other words hashmap is better for non-threading applications. HashTable should be used in multithreading applications.</p></li>\n<li><p>Null keys and null values :  Hashmap allows one null key and any number of null values, while Hashtable do not allow null keys and null values in the HashTable object.</p></li>\n<li><p>Iterating the values:  Hashmap object values are iterated by using iterator .HashTable is the only class other than vector which uses enumerator to iterate the values of HashTable object.</p></li>\n<li><p>Fail-fast iterator  : The iterator in Hashmap is fail-fast iterator while the enumerator for Hashtable is not.\nAccording to Oracle Docs,  if the Hashtable is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created in any way except the iterator\'s own remove method , then the iterator will throw ConcurrentModification Exception.\nStructural modification means adding or removing elements from the Collection object (here hashmap or hashtable) . Thus the enumerations returned by the Hashtable keys and elements methods are not fail fast.We have already explained the difference between iterator and enumeration.</p></li>\n<li><p>Performance :  Hashmap is much faster and uses less memory than Hashtable as former is unsynchronized . Unsynchronized objects are often much better in performance in compare to synchronized  object like Hashtable in single threaded environment.</p></li>\n<li><p>Superclass and Legacy :  Hashtable is a subclass of Dictionary class which is now obsolete in Jdk 1.7 ,so ,it is not used anymore. It is better off externally synchronizing a HashMap or using a ConcurrentMap implementation (e.g ConcurrentHashMap).HashMap is the subclass of the AbstractMap class. Although Hashtable and HashMap has different superclasses but they both are implementations of the "Map"  abstract data type.</p></li>\n</ol>\n', 'questionId': '40471', 'answerId': '30108941'}

{'answer': '<p>Most of the time, in enterprise applications the Java heap given is larger than the ideal size of max 12 to 16 GB. I have found it hard to make the NetBeans profiler work directly on these big java apps.</p>\n\n<p>But usually this is not needed. You can use the jmap utility that comes with the jdk to take a "live" heap dump , that is jmap will dump the heap after running GC.  Do some operation on the application, wait till the operation is completed, then take another "live" heap dump. Use tools like Eclipse MAT to load the heapdumps, sort on the histogram, see which objects have increased, or which are the highest, This would give a clue.</p>\n\n<pre><code>su  proceeuser\n/bin/jmap -dump:live,format=b,file=/tmp/2930javaheap.hrpof 2930(pid of process)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There is only one problem with this approach; Huge heap dumps, even with the live option, may be too big to transfer out to development lap, and may need a machine with enough memory/RAM to open.</p>\n\n<p>That is where the class histogram comes into picture. You can dump a live class histogram with the jmap tool. This will give only the class histogram of memory usage.Basically it won\'t have the information to chain the reference. For example it may put char array at the top. And String class somewhere below. You have to draw the connection yourself. </p>\n\n<pre><code>jdk/jdk1.6.0_38/bin/jmap -histo:live 60030 &gt; /tmp/60030istolive1330.txt\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Instead of taking two heap dumps, take two class histograms, like as described above; Then compare the class histograms and see the classes that are increasing. See if you can relate the Java classes to your application classes. This will give a pretty good hint. Here is a pythons script that can help you compare two  jmap histogram dumps. <a href="https://gist.github.com/alexcpn/a68761c94c85f0210413" rel="nofollow">histogramparser.py</a></p>\n\n<p>Finally tools like JConolse and VisualVm are essential to see the memory growth over time, and see if there is a memory leak.

{'answer': '<p>Using UUIDs is insecure, because parts of the UUID arn\'t random at all. The procedure of @erickson is very neat, but does not create strings of the same length. The following snippet should be sufficient:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/*\n * The random generator used by this class to create random keys.\n * In a holder class to defer initialization until needed.\n */\nprivate static class RandomHolder {\n    static final Random random = new SecureRandom();\n    public static String randomKey(int length) {\n        return String.format("%"+length+"s", new BigInteger(length*5/*base 32,2^5*/, random)\n            .toString(32)).replace(\'\\u0020\', \'0\');\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Why choosing <code>length*5</code>. Let\'s assume the simple case of a random string of length 1, so one random character. To get a random character containing all digits 0-9 and characters a-z, we would need a random number between 0 and 35 to get one of each character. <code>BigInteger</code> provides a constructor to generate a random number, uniformly distributed over the range <code>0 to (2^numBits - 1)</code>. Unfortunately 35 is no number which can be received by 2^numBits - 1. So we have two options: Either go with <code>2^5-1=31</code> or <code>2^6-1=63</code>. If we would choose <code>2^6</code> we would get a lot of "unnecesarry" / "longer" numbers. Therefore <code>2^5</code> is the better option, even if we loose 4 characters (w-z). To now generate a string of a certain length, we can simply use a <code>2^(length*numBits)-1</code> number. The last problem, if we want a string with a certain length, random could generate a small number, so the length is not met, so we have to pad the string to it\'s required length prepending zeros.</p>\n', 'questionId': '41107', 'answerId': '31214709'}

{'answer': '<p>Q: If I encrypt my .class files and use a custom classloader to load and decrypt them on the fly, will this prevent decompilation?</p>\n\n<p>A: The problem of preventing Java byte-code decompilation is almost as old the language itself. Despite a range of obfuscation tools available on the market, novice Java programmers continue to think of new and clever ways to protect their intellectual property. In this Java Q&amp;A installment, I dispel some myths around an idea frequently rehashed in discussion forums.</p>\n\n<p>The extreme ease with which Java .class files can be reconstructed into Java sources that closely resemble the originals has a lot to do with Java byte-code design goals and trade-offs. Among other things, Java byte code was designed for compactness, platform independence, network mobility, and ease of analysis by byte-code interpreters and JIT (just-in-time)/HotSpot dynamic compilers. Arguably, the compiled .class files express the programmer\'s intent so clearly they could be easier to analyze than the original source code.</p>\n\n<p>Several things can be done, if not to prevent decompilation completely, at least to make it more difficult. For example, as a post-compilation step you could massage the .class data to make the byte code either harder to read when decompiled or harder to decompile into valid Java code (or both). Techniques like performing extreme method name overloading work well for the former, and manipulating control flow to create control structures not possible to represent through Java syntax work well for the latter. The more successful commercial obfuscators use a mix of these and other techniques.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, both approaches must actually change the code the JVM will run, and many users are afraid (rightfully so) that this transformation may add new bugs to their applications. Furthermore, method and field renaming can cause reflection calls to stop working. Changing actual class and package names can break several other Java APIs (JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface), URL providers, etc.). In addition to altered names, if the association between class byte-code offsets and source line numbers is altered, recovering the original exception stack traces could become difficult.</p>\n\n<p>Then there is the option of obfuscating the original Java source code. But fundamentally this causes a similar set of problems.\nEncrypt, not obfuscate?</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the above has made you think, "Well, what if instead of manipulating byte code I encrypt all my classes after compilation and decrypt them on the fly inside the JVM (which can be done with a custom classloader)? Then the JVM executes my original byte code and yet there is nothing to decompile or reverse engineer, right?"</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, you would be wrong, both in thinking that you were the first to come up with this idea and in thinking that it actually works. And the reason has nothing to do with the strength of your encryption scheme.</p>\n', 'questionId': '49379', 'answerId': '32651383'}

{'answer': '<p>All of the aggregate components in Swing--that is, components made up other components, such as JTable, JTree, or JComboBox--can be highly customized. For example, a JTable component normally displays a grid of JLabel components, but it can also display JButtons, JTextFields, or even other JTables. Getting these aggregate components to display non-default objects is the easy part, however. Making them respond properly to keyboard and mouse events is a much harder task, due to Swing\'s separation of components into "renderers" and "editors." This separation was (in my opinion) a poor design choice and only serves to complicate matters when trying to extend Swing components.</p>\n\n<p>To see what I mean, try enhancing Swing\'s JList component so that it displays checkboxes instead of labels. According to Swing philosophy, this task requires implementing two interfaces: ListCellRenderer (for drawing the checkboxes) and CellEditor (for handling keyboard and mouse events on the checkboxes). Implementing the ListCellRenderer interface is easy enough, but the CellEditor interface can be rather clumsy and hard to understand. In this particular case, I would suggest forgetting CellEditor entirely and to handle input events directly, as shown in the following code.</p>\n\n<pre><code>import javax.swing.*;\nimport javax.swing.border.*;\nimport java.awt.*;\nimport java.awt.event.*;\n\npublic class CheckBoxList extends JList\n{\n   protected static Border noFocusBorder = new EmptyBorder(1, 1, 1, 1);\n\n   public CheckBoxList()\n   {\n      setCellRenderer(new CellRenderer());\n\n      addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter()\n         {\n            public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e)\n            {\n               int index = locationToIndex(e.getPoint());\n\n               if (index != -1) {\n                  JCheckBox checkbox = (JCheckBox)\n                              getModel().getElementAt(index);\n                  checkbox.setSelected(\n                                     !checkbox.isSelected());\n                  repaint();\n               }\n            }\n         }\n      );\n\n      setSelectionMode(ListSelectionModel.SINGLE_SELECTION);\n   }\n\n   protected class CellRenderer implements ListCellRenderer\n   {\n      public Component getListCellRendererComponent(\n                    JList list, Object value, int index,\n                    boolean isSelected, boolean cellHasFocus)\n      {\n         JCheckBox checkbox = (JCheckBox) value;\n         checkbox.setBackground(isSelected ?\n                 getSelectionBackground() : getBackground());\n         checkbox.setForeground(isSelected ?\n                 getSelectionForeground() : getForeground());\n         checkbox.setEnabled(isEnabled());\n         checkbox.setFont(getFont());\n         checkbox.setFocusPainted(false);\n         checkbox.setBorderPainted(true);\n         checkbox.setBorder(isSelected ?\n          UIManager.getBorder(\n           "List.focusCellHighlightBorder") : noFocusBorder);\n         return checkbox;\n      }\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, I intercept mouse clicks from the listbox and simulate a click on the appropriate checkbox. The result is a "CheckBoxList" component that is both simpler and smaller than an equivalent component using the CellEditor interface. To use the class, simply instantiate it, then pass it an array of JCheckBox objects (or subclasses of JCheckBox objects) by calling setListData. Note that the checkboxes in this component will not respond to keypresses (i.e. the spacebar), but you could always add your own key listener if needed.</p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href="http://www.devx.com/tips/Tip/5342" rel="nofollow">DevX.com</a></p>\n', 'questionId': '19766', 'answerId': '32712019'}

Because <strong>notify()</strong> doesn\'t allow you to specify the thread that is\n  woken up, it is useful only in massively parallel applications \u2014 that\n  is, programs with a large number of threads, all doing similar chores.\n  In such an application, you don\'t care which thread gets woken up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>source: <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/guardmeth.html" rel="noreferrer">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/guardmeth.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Compare <strong>notify()</strong> with <strong>notifyAll()</strong> in the above described situation: a massively parallel application where threads are doing the same thing. If you call <strong>notifyAll()</strong> in that case, <strong>notifyAll()</strong> will induce the waking up (i.e. scheduling) of a huge number of threads, many of them unnecessarily (since only one thread can actually proceed, namely the thread which will be granted the monitor for the object <strong>wait()</strong>, <strong>notify()</strong>, or <strong>notifyAll()</strong> was called on), therefore wasting computing resources.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, if you don\'t have an application where a huge number of threads do the same thing concurrently, prefer <strong>notifyAll()</strong> over <strong>notify()</strong>. Why? Because, as other users have already answered in this forum, <strong>notify()</strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object\'s monitor.

In that case, <strong>notify()</strong> might wake up only consumers and never producers because the choice who is waken up is <em>arbitrary</em>. The producer consumer cycle wouldn\'t make any progress although producers and consumers are ready to produce and consume, respectively. Instead, a consumer is woken up (i.e. leaving the <strong>wait()</strong> status), doesn\'t take an item out of the queue because it\'s empty, and <strong>notify()</strong> s another consumer to proceed.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, <strong>notifyAll()</strong> awakens both producers and consumers. The choice who is scheduled depends on the scheduler. Of course, depending on the scheduler\'s implementation, the scheduler might also only schedule consumers (e.g. if you assign consumer threads a very high priority). However, the assumption here is that the danger of the scheduler scheduling only consumers is lower than the danger of the JVM only waking up consumers because any reasonably implemented scheduler doesn\'t make just <em>arbitrary</em> decisions. Rather, most scheduler implementations make at least some effort to prevent starvation.</p>\n', 'questionId': '37026', 'answerId': '33329002'}

{'answer': '<h1>What you are trying to do is not Unit Testing</h1>\n\n<p>If you test whether or not the returned objects are instances of specific concrete classes, you aren\'t unit testing. You are integration testing. While integration testing is important, it is not the same thing.</p>\n\n<p>In unit testing, you only need to test the object itself. If you assert on the concrete type of the abstract objects returned, you are testing over the implementation of the returned object.</p>\n\n<h1>Unit Testing on Objects in general</h1>\n\n<p>When unit testing, there are four things, you want to assert:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Return values of queries (non-void methods) are what you expect them to be.</li>\n<li>Side-effects of commands (void methods) modify the object itself as you expect them to.</li>\n<li>Commands send to other objects are received (This is usually done using mocks).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Furthermore, you only want to test what could be observed from an object instance, i.e. the public interface. Otherwise you tie yourself to a specific set of implementation details. This would require you to change your tests, when those details change.</p>\n\n<h1>Unit Testing Factories</h1>\n\n<p>Unit testing on Factories is really uninteresting, because <strong>you are not interested in the behavior of the returned objects of queries</strong>. That behavior is (hopefully) tested elswhere, presumable while unit testing that object itself. You are only really interested in whether or not the returned object has the correct <em>type</em>, which is guarenteed if your program compiles.</p>\n\n<p>As Factories do not change over time (because then they would be "Builders", which is another pattern), there are no commands to test.</p>\n\n<p>Factories are responsible for instantiating objects, so they should not depend on other factories to do this for them. They <em>might</em> depend on a Builder, but even so, we are not supposed to test the Builder\'s correctness, only whether or not the Builder receives the message.</p>\n\n<p>This means that all you have to test on Factories is whether or not they send the messages to the objects on which they depend. If you use Dependency Injection, this is almsot trivial. Just mock the dependencies in your unit tests, and verify that they receive the messages.</p>\n\n<h1>Summary on Unit Testing Factories</h1>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Do not test the behavior nor the implementation details of the returned objects! Your Factory is not responsible for the implementation of the object instances!</li>\n<li>Test whether or not the commands sent to dependencies are received.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That\'s it. If there are no dependencies, there is nothing to test. Except maybe to assert that the returned object isn\'t a <code>null</code> reference.</p>\n\n<h1>Integration Testing Factories</h1>\n\n<p>If you have a requirement that the returned abstract object type is an instance of a specific concrete type, then this falls under integration testing.</p>\n\n<p>Others here have already answered how to do this using the <code>instanceof</code> operator.</p>\n', 'questionId': '37310', 'answerId': '34199097'}
{'answer': '<h1>NOT ALWAYS</h1>\n\n<p>The Java Language specification describes how try-catch-finally and try-catch blocks work at <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.20.2" rel="nofollow">14.20.2</a><br>\nIn no place it specifies that the finally block is always executed.\nBut for all cases in which the try-catch-finally and try-finally blocks complete it does specify that before completion finally must be executed.</p>\n\n<p>In other words. If <em>NEXT</em> is the code to be executed after the try-catch-finally or try-finally block and <em>FIN</em> is the code in the finally block, the JLS guarantees that <strong><em>FIN</em> will always be executed before <em>NEXT</em>.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Why doesn\'t the JLS guarantee that the finally block is always executed after the try block? Because it is impossible. It is unlikely but possible that the JVM will be aborted (kill, crash, power off) just after completing the try block but before execution of the finally block. There is nothing the JLS can do to avoid this.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, any software which for their proper behaviour depends on finally blocks always being executed after their try blocks complete are bugged.</p>\n\n<p>Returns in the try block are irrelevant to this issue.

{'answer': u'<p>A logical way to think about this is:</p>\n\n<p>Code placed in a finally block must be executed whatever occurs within the try block.</p>\n\n<p>So if code in the try block tries to return a value or throw an exception the item is placed \u2018on the shelf\u2019 till the finally block can execute\nBecause code in the finally block has (by definition) a high priority it can return or throw whatever it likes. In which case anything left \u2018on the shelf\u2019 is discarded.</p>\n\n<p>The only exception to this is if the VM shuts down completely during the try block e.g. by \u2018System.exit\u2019</p>\n\n<p><strong>Never throw any exception from finally block</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>try {\n  someMethod();  //Throws exceptionOne\n} finally {\n  cleanUp();    //If finally also threw any exception the exceptionOne will be lost forever\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is fine, as long as cleanUp() can never throw any exception. In the above example, if someMethod() throws an exception, and in the finally block also, cleanUp() throws an exception, that second exception will come out of method and the original first exception (correct reason) will be lost forever. If the code that you call in a finally block can possibly throw an exception, make sure that you either handle it, or log it. Never let it come out of the finally block.</p>\n\n<p>Actually exiting the program (either by calling System.exit() or by causing a fatal error that causes the process to abort: sometimes referred to informally as a "hotspot" or "Dr Watson" in Windows) will prevent your finally block from being executed!</p>\n\n<p>There\'s nothing to stop us nesting try/catch/finally blocks (for example, putting a try/finally block inside a try/catch block, or vice versa), and it\'s not such an uncommon thing to do.</p>\n', 'questionId': '65035', 'answerId': '34408847'}

{'answer': '<p>Thanks to original post. I have reskinned this utility class and come up over the flaws which it had earlier, thought it might help others so posting here. I have also added some extra utility methods. Now it is able to read any file in windows registry(including REG_DWORD, REG_BINARY, REG_EXPAND_SZ etc.). All the methods work like a charm.

{'answer': '<p>Yes, you should avoid using label unless there\'s a specific reason to use them (the example of it simplifying implementation of an algorithm is pertinent). In such a case I would advise adding sufficient comments or other documentation to explain the reasoning behind it so that someone doesn\'t come along later and mangle it out of some notion of "improving the code" or "getting rid of code smell" or some other potentially BS excuse.  </p>\n\n<p>I would equate this sort of question with deciding when one should or shouldn\'t use the ternary if. The chief rationale being that it can impede readability and unless the programmer is very careful to name things in a reasonable way then use of conventions such as labels might make things a lot worse. Suppose the example using \'nextCondition\' and \'nextItem\' had used \'loop1\' and \'loop2\' for his label names.  </p>\n\n<p>Personally labels are one of those features that don\'t make a lot of sense to me, outside of Assembly or BASIC and other similarly limited languages.

{'answer': '<p>A lot of the confusion surrounding this issue comes from the fact that Java has attempted to redefine what "Pass by value" and "Pass by reference" mean. It\'s important to understand that these are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jargon" rel="nofollow">Industry Terms</a>, and cannot be correctly understood outside of that context. They are meant to help you as you code and are valuable to understand, so let\'s first go over what they mean. </p>\n\n<p>A good description of both can be found <a href="http://cplus.about.com/od/glossar1/g/passbyrefdefn.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pass By Value</strong> The value the function received is a copy of the object the caller is using. It is entirely unique to the function and anything you do to that object will only be seen within the function.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pass By Reference</strong> The value the function received is a reference to the object the caller is using. Anything the function does to the object that value refers to will be seen by the caller and it will be working with those changes from that point on.</p>\n\n<p>As is clear from those definitions, the fact that the reference is passed by value is irrelevant. If we were to accept that definition, then these terms become meaningless and all languages everywhere are only Pass By Value.</p>\n\n<p>No matter how you pass the reference in, it can only ever be passed by value. That isn\'t the point. The point is that you passed a reference to your own object to the function, not a copy of it. The fact that you can throw away the reference you received is irrelevant. Again, if we accepted that definition, these terms become meaningless and everyone is always passing by value.</p>\n\n<p>And no, C++\'s special "pass by reference" syntax is not the exclusive definition of pass by reference. It is purely a convenience syntax meant to make it so that you don\'t need to use pointer syntax after passing the pointer in. It is still passing a pointer, the compiler is just hiding that fact from you. It also still passes that pointer BY VALUE, the compiler is just hiding that from you.</p>\n\n<p>So, with this understanding, we can look at Java and see that it actually has both. All Java primitive types are always pass by value because you receive a copy of the caller\'s object and cannot modify their copy. All Java reference types are always pass by reference because you receive a reference to the caller\'s object and can directly modify their object. </p>\n\n<p>The fact that you cannot modify the caller\'s reference has nothing to do with pass by reference and is true in every language that supports pass by reference.</p>\n', 'questionId': '40480', 'answerId': '37190132'}

{'answer': '<p>I would suggest you refactoring your code a little bit. When you have to start thinking about using reflection or other kind of stuff, for just testing your code, something is going wrong with your code.</p>\n\n<p>You mentioned different types of problems. Let\'s start with private fields. In case of private fields I would have added a new constructor and injected fields into that. Instead of this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ClassToTest {\n\n    private final String first = "first";\n    private final List&lt;String&gt; second = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I\'d have used this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ClassToTest {\n\n    private final String first;\n    private final List&lt;String&gt; second;\n\n    public ClassToTest() {\n        this("first", new ArrayList&lt;&gt;());\n    }\n\n    public ClassToTest(final String first, final List&lt;String&gt; second) {\n        this.first = first;\n        this.second = second;\n    }\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This won\'t be a problem even with some legacy code. Old code will be using an empty constructor, and if you ask me, refactored code will look cleaner, and you\'ll be able to inject necessary values in test without reflection.</p>\n\n<p>Now about private methods. In my personal experience when you have to stub a private method for testing, then that method has nothing to do in that class. A common pattern, in that case, would be to <em>wrap</em> it within an interface, like <code>Callable</code> and then you pass in that interface also in the constructor (with that multiple constructor trick):</p>\n\n<pre><code>public ClassToTest() {\n    this(...);\n}\n\npublic ClassToTest(final Callable&lt;T&gt; privateMethodLogic) {\n    this.privateMethodLogic = privateMethodLogic;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Mostly all that I wrote looks like it\'s a dependency injection pattern. In my personal experience it\'s really useful while testing, and I think that this kind of code is cleaner and will be easier to maintain. I\'d say the same about nested classes. If a nested class contains heavy logic it would be better if you\'d moved it as a package private class and have injected it into a class needing it.</p>\n\n<p>There are also several other design patterns which I have used while refactoring and maintaining legacy code, but it all depends on cases of your code to test. Using reflection mostly is not a problem, but when you have an enterprise application which is heavily tested and tests are run before every deployment everything gets really slow (it\'s just annoying and I don\'t like that kind of stuff).</p>\n\n<p>There is also setter injection, but I wouldn\'t recommended using it. I\'d better stick with a constructor and initialize everything when it\'s really necessary, leaving the possibility for injecting necessary dependencies.</p>\n', 'questionId': '34571', 'answerId': '39215279'}

{'answer': '<p>As an subjective question this should be closed, but as its still open:</p>\n\n<p>This is part of the the internal policy used at my previous place of employment and it worked really well. This is all from memory so I can\'t remember the exact wording. Its worth noting that they did not use checked exceptions, but that is beyond the scope of the question. The unchecked exceptions they did use fell into 3 main categories.</p>\n\n<p>NullPointerException: Do not throw intentionally. NPEs are to be thrown only by the VM when dereferencing a null reference. All possible effort is to be made to ensure that these are never thrown. @Nullable and @NotNull should be used in conjunction with code analysis tools to find these errors.</p>\n\n<p>IllegalArgumentException: Thrown when an argument to a function does not conform to the public documentation, such that the error can be identified and described in terms of the arguments passed in. The OP\'s situation would fall into this category.</p>\n\n<p>IllegalStateException: Thrown when a function is called and its arguments are either unexpected at the time they are passed or incompatible with the state of the object the method is a member of.</p>\n\n<p>For example, there were two internal versions of the IndexOutOfBoundsException used in things that had a length. One a sub-class of IllegalStateException, used if the index was larger than the length. The other a subclass of IllegalArgumentException, used if the index was negative. This was because you could add more items to the object and the argument would be valid, while a negative number is never valid.</p>\n\n<p>As I said, this system works really well, and it took someone to explain why the distinction is there: "Depending on the type of error it is quite straight forward for you to figure out what to do. Even if you can\'t actually figure out what went wrong you can figure out where to catch that error and create additional debugging information."</p>\n\n<p>NullPointerException: Handle the Null case or put in an assertion so that the NPE is not thrown. If you put in an assertion it must one of the other two types. If possible, continue debugging as if the assertion was there in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>IllegalArgumentException: you have something wrong at your callsite. If the values being passed in are from another function, find out why you are receiving an incorrect value. If you are passing in one of your arguments propagate the error checks up the call stack until you find the function that is not returning what you expect.</p>\n\n<p>IllegalStateException: You have not called your functions in the correct order. If you are using one of your arguments, check them and throw an IllegalArgumentException describing the issue. You can then propagate the cheeks up the stack until you find the issue.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, his point was that you can only copy the IllegalArgumentAssertions up the stack. There is no way for you to propagate the IllegalStateExceptions or NullPointerExceptions up the stack because they had something to do with your function.</p>\n', 'questionId': '3881', 'answerId': '39658107'}
{'answer': u'<p>Java does manipulate objects by reference, and all object variables are references. However, Java doesn\'t pass method arguments by reference; it passes them by value.</p>\n\n<p>Take the\xa0badSwap()\xa0method for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public void badSwap(int var1, int\n var2{ int temp = var1; var1 = var2; var2 =\n temp; }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When\xa0badSwap()\xa0returns, the variables passed as arguments will still hold their original values. The method will also fail if we change the arguments type from\xa0int\xa0to\xa0Object, since Java passes object references by value as well. Now, here is where it gets tricky:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void tricky(Point arg1, Point   arg2)\n{ arg1.x = 100; arg1.y = 100; Point temp = arg1; arg1 = arg2; arg2 = temp; }\npublic static void main(String [] args) { \n\n Point pnt1 = new Point(0,0); Point pnt2\n = new Point(0,0); System.out.println("X:\n " + pnt1.x + " Y: " +pnt1.y);\n\n     System.out.println("X: " + pnt2.x + " Y:\n " +pnt2.y); System.out.println(" ");\n\n     tricky(pnt1,pnt2);\n System.out.println("X: " + pnt1.x + " Y:" + pnt1.y);\n\n     System.out.println("X: " + pnt2.x + " Y: " +pnt2.y); }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If we execute this\xa0main()\xa0method, we see the following output:</p>\n\n<p>X: 0 Y: 0 X: 0 Y: 0 X: 100 Y: 100 X: 0 Y: 0</p>\n\n<p>The method successfully alters the value ofpnt1, even though it is passed by value; however, a swap of\xa0pnt1\xa0and\xa0pnt2\xa0fails! This is the major source of confusion. In themain()\xa0method,\xa0pnt1\xa0and\xa0pnt2\xa0are nothing more than object references. When you passpnt1\xa0and\xa0pnt2\xa0to the\xa0tricky()\xa0method, Java passes the references by value just like any other parameter. This means the references passed to the method are actually\xa0copies\xa0of the original references. Figure 1 below shows two references pointing to the same object after Java passes an object to a method.</p>\n\n<p>Java copies and passes the\xa0reference\xa0by value, not the object. Thus, method manipulation will alter the objects, since the references point to the original objects. But since the references are copies, swaps will fail. As Figure 2 illustrates, the method references swap, but not the original references. Unfortunately, after a method call, you are left with only the unswapped original references. For a swap to succeed outside of the method call, we need to swap the original references, not the copies.</p>\n', 'questionId': '40480', 'answerId': '39709353'}

{'answer': '<p>Java, for sure, without a doubt, is "pass by value". Also, since Java is (mostly) object-oriented and objects work with references, it\'s easy to get confused and think of it to be "pass by reference"</p>\n\n<p>Pass by value means you pass the value to the method and if the method changes the passed value, the real entity doesn\'t change. Pass by reference, on the other hand, means a reference is passed to the method, and if the method changes it, the passed object also changes.</p>\n\n<p>In Java, usually when we pass an object to a method, we basically pass the reference of the object as-a-value because that\'s how Java works; it works with references and addresses as far as Object in the heap goes.</p>\n\n<p>But to test if it is really pass by value or pass by reference, you can use a primitive type and references:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Test\npublic void sampleTest(){\n    int i = 5;\n    incrementBy100(i);\n    System.out.println("passed ==&gt; "+ i);\n    Integer j = new Integer(5);\n    incrementBy100(j);\n    System.out.println("passed ==&gt; "+ j);\n}\n/**\n * @param i\n */\nprivate void incrementBy100(int i) {\n    i += 100;\n    System.out.println("incremented = "+ i);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The output is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>incremented = 105\npassed ==&gt; 5\nincremented = 105\npassed ==&gt; 5\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So in both cases, whatever happens inside the method doesn\'t change the real Object, because the value of that object was passed, and not a reference to the object itself.</p>\n\n<p>But when you pass a custom object to a method, and the method and changes it, it will change the real object too, because even when you passed the object, you passed it\'s reference as a value to the method. Let\'s try another example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Test\npublic void sampleTest2(){\n    Person person = new Person(24, "John");\n    System.out.println(person);\n    alterPerson(person);\n    System.out.println(person);\n}\n\n/**\n * @param person\n */\nprivate void alterPerson(Person person) {\n    person.setAge(45);\n    Person altered = person;\n    altered.setName("Tom");\n}\n\nprivate static class Person{\n    private int age;\n    private String name; \n\n    public Person(int age, String name) {\n        this.age=age;\n        this.name =name;\n    }\n\n    public int getAge() {\n        return age;\n    }\n\n    public void setAge(int age) {\n        this.age = age;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public void setName(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();\n        builder.append("Person [age=");\n        builder.append(age);\n        builder.append(", name=");\n        builder.append(name);\n        builder.append("]");\n        return builder.toString();\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this case, the output is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Person [age=24, name=John]\nPerson [age=45, name=Tom]\n</code></pre>\n', 'questionId': '40480', 'answerId': '41393112'}
{'answer': '<p>There is a certain amount of opinion to answer this.  To start with, constants in java are generally declared to be public, static and final.

{'answer': "<p>While there are some solid answers above, I am surprised by the number of confusions and misunderstandings I have read. This probably proves the idea that one should use java.util.concurrent as much as possible instead of trying to write own broken concurrent code.\nBack to the question: to summarize, the best practice today is to AVOID notify() in ALL situations due to the lost wakeup problem. Anyone who doesn't understand this should not be allowed to write mission critical concurrency code. If you are worried about the herding problem, one safe way to achieve waking one thread up at a time is to:\n1. Build an explicit waiting queue for the waiting threads;\n2. Have each of the thread in the queue wait for it's predecessor;\n3. Have each thread call notifyAll() when done.\nOr you can use Java.util.concurrent.*, which have already implemented this.</p>\n", 'questionId': '37026', 'answerId': '41910658'}

So here you go...</p>\n\n<p>Now, keep in mind that <code>super()</code> has to be called before anything else in a subclass's constructor, so, if you did use <code>try</code> and <code>catch</code> blocks around your <code>super()</code> call, the blocks would have to look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>try {\n   super();\n   ...\n} catch (Exception e) {\n   super(); //This line will throw the same error...\n   ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If super()<code>fails in the</code>try<code>block, it HAS to be executed first in the</code>catch<code>block, so that</code>super<code>runs before anything in your subclass</code>s constructor. This leaves you with the same problem you had at the beginning: if an exception is thrown, it isn't caught. (In this case it just gets thrown again in the catch block.)</p>\n\n<p>Now, the above code is in no way allowed by Java either. This code may execute half of the first super call, and then call it again, which could cause some problems with some super classes.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the reason that Java doesn't let you throw an exception <em>instead</em> of calling <code>super()</code> is because the exception could be caught somewhere else, and the program would continue <strong>without calling <code>super()</code> on your subclass object,</strong> and possibly because the exception could take your object as a parameter and try to change the value of inherited instance variables, which would not yet have been initialized.</p>\n", 'questionId': '5328', 'answerId': '43454831'}

But <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13109588/base64-encoding-in-java">numerous libraries exist</a> that add this.

This will use <code>A-Z</code> and <code>2-7</code> making it reasonably space efficient while being case-insensitive alpha-numeric. Like with <code>Base64</code> there is no <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21515479/encode-string-to-base32-string-in-java">standard implementation in JDK</a>.

{'answer': '<blockquote>\n  <p>What is the best way to implement constants in Java?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>One approach that we should really avoid</strong> : using interfaces to define constants.<br></p>\n\n<p>Creating a interface specifically to declare constants is really the worst thing : it defeats the reason why interfaces were designed : defining method(s) contract.<br></p>\n\n<p>Even if an interface already exists to address a specific need, declaring the constants in them make really not sense as constants should not make part of the API and the contract provided to client classes.<br></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>To simplify, we have broadly 4 valid approaches</strong>.<br></p>\n\n<p>With <code>static final String/Integer</code> field :</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1) using a class that declare constants inside but not only.</li>\n<li>1 variant) creating a class dedicated to only declare constants.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>With <code>Java 5 enum</code> :</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>2) declaring the enum in a related purpose class (nested class).</li>\n<li>2 variant) creating the enum alone (not in a outer class).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR : Which is the best way and where locate the constants ?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In most of cases, the enum way is probably finer than the <code>static final String/Integer</code> way</strong> and personally I think that the <code>static final String/Integer</code> way should be used only if we have good reasons to not use enums.<br>\nAnd about where we should declare the constant values, <strong>the idea is to search if there exists a class that own a strong semantic and use relationship with constant values. If we find it, we should use it as the constants holder</strong>. Otherwise, the constant should be associated to no one particular class.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong><code>static final String</code>/ <code>static final Integer</code> versus <code>enum</code></strong> </p>\n\n<p>Enums usage is really a way to strongly considered.<br>\nEnums have a great advantage over <code>String</code> or <code>Integer</code> constant field. <br>\nThey set a stronger compilation constraint. \nIf you define a method that takes the enum as parameter, you can only pass a enum value defined in the enum class(or null). <br>\nWith String and Integer you can substitute them with any values of compatible type and the compilation will be fine even if the value is not a defined constant in the <code>static final String</code>/ <code>static final Integer</code> fields. </p>\n\n<p>For example, below two constants defined in a class as <code>static final String</code> fields :</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MyClass{\n\n   public static final String ONE_CONSTANT = "value";\n   public static final String ANOTHER_CONSTANT = "other value";\n   . . .\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here a method that expects to have one of these constants as parameter :</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void process(String constantExpected){\n    ...    \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can invoke it in this way :</p>\n\n<pre><code>process(MyClass.ONE_CONSTANT);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or </p>\n\n<pre><code>process(MyClass.ANOTHER_CONSTANT);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But no compilation constraint prevents you from invoking it in this way :</p>\n\n<pre><code>process("a not defined constant value");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You would have the error only at runtime and only if you do at a time a check on the transmitted value.</p>\n\n<p>With enum, checks are not required as the client could only pass a enum value in a enum parameter.<br></p>\n\n<p>For example, here two values defined in a enum class (so constant out of the box):</p>\n\n<pre><code>public enum MyEnum {\n\n    ONE_CONSTANT("value"), ANOTHER_CONSTANT(" another value");\n\n    private String value;\n\n    MyEnum(String value) {\n       this.value = value;\n    }\n         ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here a method that expects to have one of these enum values as parameter :</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void process(MyEnum myEnum){\n    ...    \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can invoke it in this way :</p>\n\n<pre><code>process(MyEnum.ONE_CONSTANT);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or </p>\n\n<pre><code>process(MyEnum.ANOTHER_CONSTANT);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But the compilation will never allow you from invoking it in this way :</p>\n\n<pre><code>process("a not defined constant value");\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Where should we declare the constants ?</strong></p>\n\n<p>If your application contains an existing class that has a specific and strong functional cohesion with the constant values, the 1) and the 2) appear more intuitive.<br>\nGenerally, it eases the use of the constants if these are declared in the main class that manipulates them or that has a name very natural to guess that we will find it inside.<br></p>\n\n<p>For example in the JDK library, the exponential and pi constant values are   declared in a class that declare not only constant declarations (<code>java.lang.Math</code>).</p>\n\n<pre><code>   public final class Math {\n          ...\n       public static final double E = 2.7182818284590452354;\n       public static final double PI = 3.14159265358979323846;\n         ...\n   }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The clients using mathematics functions rely often on the <code>Math</code> class.\nSo, they may find constants easily enough and can also remember where <code>E</code> and <code>PI</code> are defined in a very natural way.<br>    </p>\n\n<p>If your application doesn\'t contain an existing class that has a very specific and strong functional cohesion with the constant values, the 1 variant) and the 2 variant) ways appear more intuitive.<br>\nGenerally, it doesn\'t ease the use of the constants if these are declared in one class that manipulates them while we have also 3 or 4 other classes that manipulate them as much as and no one of these classes seems be more natural than others to host constant values.<br>\nHere, defining a custom class to hold only constant values makes sense.<br>\nFor example in the JDK library, the <code>java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit</code> enum is not declared in a specific class as there is not really one and only one JDK specific class that appear as the most intuitive to hold it :</p>\n\n<pre><code>public enum TimeUnit {\n    NANOSECONDS {\n      .....\n    },\n    MICROSECONDS {\n      .....\n    },\n    MILLISECONDS {\n      .....\n    },\n    SECONDS {\n      .....\n    },\n      .....\n}      \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Many classes declared in <code>java.util.concurrent</code> use them :\n<code>BlockingQueue</code>, <code>ArrayBlockingQueue&lt;E&gt;</code>, <code>CompletableFuture</code>, <code>ExecutorService</code> , ... and really no one of them seems more appropriate to hold the enum.<br></p>\n', 'questionId': '66066', 'answerId': '44452756'}
