{'answer': u"This has religious war potential, but it seems to me that if you're using a getter/setter, you should use it internally as well - using both will lead to maintenance problems down the road (e.g. somebody adds code to a setter that needs to run every time that property is set, and the property is being set internally w/o that setter being called).\n", 'questionId': '126', 'answerId': '127'}
{'answer': u"It depends on how the property is used. For example, say you have a student object that has a name property. You could use your Get method to pull the name from the database, if it hasn't been retrieved already. This way you are reducing unnecessary calls to the database.\nNow let's say you have a private integer counter in your object that counts the number of times the name has been called.

{'answer': u"Well, it seems with C# 3.0 properties' default implementation, the decision is taken for you; you HAVE to set the property using the (possibly private) property setter.\nI personally only use the private member-behind when not doing so would cause the object to fall in an less than desirable state, such as when initializing or when caching/lazy loading is involved.\n", 'questionId': '126', 'answerId': '142'}
{'answer': u"As stated in some of the comments: Sometimes you should, sometimes you shouldn't. The great part about private variables is that you are able to see all the places they are used when you change something. If your getter/setter does something you need, use it.

{'answer': u"Personally, I feel like it's important to remain consistent.  If you have getters and setters, use them.

{'answer': u"This warning is there because Java is not actually storing type information at run-time in an object that uses generics.

{'answer': u'In Java, the \'int\' type is a primitive , whereas the \'Integer\' type is an object.\nIn C#, the \'int\' type is the same as System.Int32 and is a value type (ie more like the java \'int\'). An integer (just like any other value types) can be boxed ("wrapped") into an object. \n\nThe differences between objects and primitives are somewhat beyond the scope of this question, but to summarize: \nObjects provide facilities for polymorphism, are passed by reference (or more accurately have references passed by value), and are allocated from the heap. Conversely, primitives are immutable types that are passed by value and are often allocated from the stack.\n', 'questionId': '564', 'answerId': '566'}

Meaning, if you made a new Integer:\n\nYou could call some method on i:\n\nWhereas with an int:\n\nYou cannot call any methods on it, because it is simply a primitive. So:\n\nwould produce an error, because int is not an object.\nint is one of the few primitives in Java (along with char and some others). I'm not 100% sure, but I'm thinking that the Integer object more or less just has an int property and a whole bunch of methods to interact with that property (like the toString() method for example). So Integer is a fancy way to work with an int (Just as perhaps String is a fancy way to work with a group of chars).\nI know that Java isn't C, but since I've never programmed in C this is the closest I could come to the answer.

{'answer': u"I'll add to the excellent answers given above, and talk about boxing and unboxing, and how this applies to Java (although C# has it too). I'll use just Java terminology, because I am more au fait with that.\nAs the answers mentioned, int is just a number (called the unboxed type), whereas Integer is an object (which contains the number, hence a boxed type). In Java terms, that means (apart from not being able to call methods on int), you cannot store int or other non-object types in collections (List, Map, etc.). In order to store them, you must first box them up in its corresponding boxed type.\nJava 5 onwards have something called auto-boxing and auto-unboxing which allow the boxing/unboxing to be done behind the scenes. Compare and contrast: Java 5 version:\n\nJava 1.4 or earlier (no generics either):\n\nIt must be noted that despite the brevity in the Java 5 version, both versions generate identical bytecode. Thus, although auto-boxing and auto-unboxing is very convenient because you write less code, these operations do happen behind the scenes, with the same runtime costs, so you still have to be aware of their existence.\nHope this helps!\n", 'questionId': '564', 'answerId': '608'}

{'answer': u"I'll just post here since some of the other posts are slightly inaccurate in relation to C#.\nCorrect: int is an alias for System.Int32.\nWrong: float is not an alias for System.Float, but for System.Single\nBasically, int is a reserved keyword in the C# programming language, and is an alias for the System.Int32 value type.\nfloat and Float is not the same however, as the right system type for ''float'' is System.Single. There are some types like this that has reserved keywords that doesn't seem to match the type names directly.\nIn C# there is no difference between ''int'' and ''System.Int32'', or any of the other pairs or keywords/system types, except for when defining enums. With enums you can specify the storage size to use and in this case you can only use the reserved keyword, and not the system runtime type name.\nWether the value in the int will be stored on the stack, in memory, or as a referenced heap object depends on the context and how you use it.\nThis declaration in a method:\n\ndefines a variable i of type System.Int32, living in a register or on the stack, depending on optimizations. The same declaration in a type (struct or class) defines a member field. The same declaration in a method argument list defines a parameter, with the same storage options as for a local variable. (note that this paragraph is not valid if you start pulling iterator methods into the mix, these are different beasts altogether)\nTo get a heap object, you can use boxing:\n\nthis will create a boxed copy of the contents of i on the heap. In IL you can access methods on the heap object directly, but in C# you need to cast it back to an int, which will create another copy. Thus, the object on the heap cannot easily be changed in C# without creating a new boxed copy of a new int value.

{'answer': u'Yes, this is possible. One of the main pros for using Swing is the ease with which the abstract controls can be created and manipulates.\nHere is a quick and dirty way to extend the existing JButton class to draw a circle to the right of the text.\n\nNote that by overriding paintComponent that the contents of the button can be changed, but that the border is painted by the paintBorder method. The getPreferredSize method also needs to be managed in order to dynamically support changes to the content. Care needs to be taken when measuring font metrics and image dimensions.\nFor creating a control that you can rely on, the above code is not the correct approach.

{'answer': u'Regarding Java 1.5 and autoboxing there is an important "quirk" that comes to play when comparing Integer objects.\nIn Java, Integer objects with the values -128 to 127 are immutable (that is, for one particular integer value, say 23, all Integer objects instantiated through your program with the value 23 points to the exact same object).\nExample, this returns true:\n\nWhile this returns false:\n\nThe == compares by reference (does the variables point to the same object).\nThis result may or may not differ depending on what JVM you are using.

{'answer': u'In Java there are two basic types in the JVM. 1) Primitive types and 2) Reference Types. int is a primitive type and Integer is a class type (which is kind of reference type).\nPrimitive values do not share state with other primitive values. A variable whose type is a primitive type always holds a primitive value of that type.\n\nAn object is a dynamically created class instance or an array. The reference values (often just references) are pointers to these objects and a special null reference, which refers to no object. There may be many references to the same object.\n\nAlso in Java everything is passed by value. With objects the value that is passed is the reference to the object. So another difference between int and Integer in java is how they are passed in method calls. For example in\n\nThe variable two is passed as the primitive integer type 2. Whereas in\n\nThe variable two is passed as a reference to an object that holds the integer value 2.\n\n@WolfmanDragon:\nPass by reference would work like so:\n\nWhen increment is called it passes a reference (pointer) to variable a.

{'answer': u"I'm not sure if this would be handled exactly the same way for webstart, but we ran into this situation in a desktop application when dealing with a set of native libraries (dlls in our case).\nLoading libA before libB should work, unless one of those libraries has a dependency that is unaccounted for and not in the path. My understanding is that once it gets to a system loadLibrary call (i.e. Java has found the library in its java.library.path and is now telling the OS to load it) - it is completely dependent on the operating system to find any dependent libraries, because at that point it is the operating system that is loading the library for the process, and the OS only knows how to look in the system path. That seems hard to set in the case of a Webstart app, but there is a way around this that does not involve static compiling. You may be able to shuffle where your libraries are - I am unsure \nIf you use a custom classloader, you can override loadLibrary and findLibrary so that it can locate your libraries from within a jar in your classpath, and if you also make it aware of your native library dependencies (i.e. libB depends on libA depends on libX, then when loading libB you can catch yourself and ensure you load libA first, and in checking that notice and load libX first. Then the OS doesn't try to find a library that isn't in your path. It's klunky and a bit painful, but ensuring Java finds them and loads them all in the correct order can work.\n", 'questionId': '4630', 'answerId': '5042'}
{'answer': u'In the first case, you have a widening conversion happening. This can be see when runinng the "javap" utility program (included w/ the JDK), on the compiled class:\n\nClearly, you see the I2L, which is the mnemonic for the widening Integer-To-Long bytecode instruction. See reference here.\nAnd in the other case, replacing the "long x" with the object "Long x" signature, you\'ll have this code in the main method:\n\nSo you see the compiler has created the instruction Integer.valueOf(int), to box the primitive inside the wrapper.\n', 'questionId': '4922', 'answerId': '5091'}
{'answer': u'Another interesting thing with this example is the method overloading. The combination of type widening and method overloading only working because the compiler has to make a decision of which method to choose.

{'answer': u"Unfortunately, compilers can't work on theoretical principles, and even though you may know that it is safe in your case, if they allowed it, it would have to be safe for all cases.\nIn other words, the compiler isn't stopping just you, it's stopping everyone, including all those that don't know that it is unsafe and needs special handling. There are probably other reasons for this as well, as all languages usually have ways to do unsafe things if one knows how to deal with them.\nIn C# .NET there are similar provisions, and the only way to declare a constructor that calls a base constructor is this:\n\nin doing so, the base constructor will be called before the body of the constructor, and you cannot change this order.\n", 'questionId': '5328', 'answerId': '5351'}
{'answer': u"I don't know how Java is implemented internally, but if the constructor of the superclass throws an exception, then there isn't a instance of the class you extend.  It would be impossible to call the toString() or equals() methods, for example, since they are inherited in most cases.\nJava may allow a try/catch around the super() call in the constructor if 1. you override ALL methods from the superclasses, and 2. you don't use the super.XXX() clause, but that all sounds too complicated to me.\n", 'questionId': '5328', 'answerId': '5357'}
{'answer': u"I can't presume to have a deep understanding of Java internals, but it is my understanding that, when a compiler needs to instantiate a derived class, it has to first create the base (and its base before that(...)) and then slap on the extensions made in the subclass. \nSo it is not even the danger of uninited variables or anything like that at all. When you try to do something in the subclass' constructor before the base class' constructor, you are basically asking the compiler to extend a base object instance that doesn't exist yet.\nEdit:In your case, MyClass becomes the base object, and MyClassMock is a subclass.\n", 'questionId': '5328', 'answerId': '5360'}

{'answer': u'The short answer\nUse one of these two methods:\n\nClass.getResource(String)\nClass.getResourceAsStream(String)\n\nFor example:\n\n--\nThe long answer\nTypically, one would not want to load files using absolute paths. For example, don\u2019t do this if you can help it:\n\nThis technique is not recommended for at least two reasons. First, it creates a dependency on a particular operating system, which prevents the application from easily moving to another operating system. One of Java\u2019s main benefits is the ability to run the same bytecode on many different platforms. Using an absolute path like this makes the code much less portable.\nSecond, depending on the relative location of the file, this technique might create an external dependency and limit the application\u2019s mobility. If the file exists outside the application\u2019s current directory, this creates an external dependency and one would have to be aware of the dependency in order to move the application to another machine (error prone).\nInstead, use the getResource() methods in the Class class. This makes the application much more portable. It  can be moved to different platforms, machines, or directories and still function correctly.\n', 'questionId': '6639', 'answerId': '6640'}
{'answer': u"I used JFreeChart (http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/) on a previous project.

{'answer': u"First I would say, don't rewrite all your tests just to suit the latest fad.  Junit3 works perfectly well, and the introduction of annotations in 4 doesn't buy you very much (in my opinion).  It is much more important that you guys write tests, and it sounds like you do.  \nUse whatever seems most natural and helps you get your work done.\nI can't comment on TestNG b/c I haven't used it.

{'answer': u'I\'ve used both, but I have to agree with Justin Standard that you shouldn\'t really consider rewriting your existing tests to any new format.  Regardless of the decision, it is pretty trivial to run both.  TestNG strives to be much more configurable than JUnit, but in the end they both work equally well.\nTestNG has a neat feature where you can mark tests as a particular group, and then easily run all tests of a specific group, or exclude tests of a particular group.  Thus you can mark tests that run slowly as in the "slow" group and then ignore them when you want quick results.  A suggestion from their documentation is to mark some subset as "checkin" tests which should be run whenever you check new files in.  I never saw such a feature in JUnit, but then again, if you don\'t have it, you don\'t REALLY miss it.\nFor all its claims of high configuration, I did run into a corner case the a couple weeks ago where I couldn\'t do what I wanted to do... I wish I could remember what it is, but I wanted to bring it up so you know that it\'s not perfect.\nThe biggest advantage TestNG has is annotations... which JUnit added in version 4 anyways.\n', 'questionId': '6658', 'answerId': '6671'}

{'answer': u"@jatan\n\nThanks for you answer. It makes sense. Can you please explain me MathContext in the context of BigDecimal#round method.\n\nThere's nothing special about BigDecimal.round() vs. any other BigDecimal method.  In all cases, the MathContext specifies the number of significant digits and the rounding technique.  Basically, there are two parts of every MathContext.  There's a precision, and there's also a RoundingMode.\nThe precision again specifies the number of significant digits.  So if you specify 123 as a number, and ask for 2 significant digits, you're going to get 120.  It might be clearer if you think in terms of scientific notation.\n123 would be 1.23e2 in scientific notation.  If you only keep 2 significant digits, then you get 1.2e2, or 120.  By reducing the number of significant digits, we reduce the precision with which we can specify a number.\nThe RoundingMode part specifies how we should handle the loss of precision.  To reuse the example, if you use 123 as the number, and ask for 2 significant digits, you've reduced your precision.  With a RoundingMode of HALF_UP (the default mode), 123 will become 120.  With a RoundingMode of CEILING, you'll get 130.\nFor example:\n\nOutputs:\n\nYou can see that both the precision and the rounding mode affect the output.\n", 'questionId': '7539', 'answerId': '7561'}

These names can get pretty long, but import keeps them all at the top of files and IDEs can help to manage that as well.\nExceptions usually go in the same package as the classes that throw them, so if you had, say, FileStorageException it would go in the same package as FileStorageStrategy.

I failed to find a way to force the creation of a new EDT thread for each applet. This means that the threadlocal for the EDT would be shared across the applets. This one I have no idea how to solve.

{'answer': u'This defect (found here) points the way to the solution. The Tomcat instance that runs in JBoss is configured with emptySessionPath="true", rather than "false", which is the default. This can be modified in .../deploy/jboss-web.deployer/server.xml; both the HTTP and AJP connectors have this option.\nThe feature itself is used to eliminate the context path (eg. "foo" in http://example.com/foo) from being included in the JSESSIONID cookie.

{'answer': u'One thing I\'ve done in the past - if I\'m extending a class I\'ll try and follow their conventions. For example, when working with the Spring Framework, I\'ll have my MVC Controller classes in a package called com.mydomain.myapp.web.servlet.mvc\nIf I\'m not extending something I just go with what is simplest. com.mydomain.domain for Domain Objects (although if you have a ton of domain objects this package could get a bit unwieldy).\nFor domain specific constants, I actually put them as public constants in the most related class. For example, if I have a "Member" class and have a maximum member name length constant, I put it in the Member class. Some shops make a separate Constants class but I don\'t see the value in lumping unrelated numbers and strings into a single class. I\'ve seen some other shops try to solve this problem by creating SEPARATE Constants classes, but that just seems like a waste of time and the result is too confusing. Using this setup, a large project with multiple developers will be duplicating constants all over the place.\n', 'questionId': '7596', 'answerId': '8335'}

{'answer': u"I found the information based on Kevin Kenny's answer, but I figured I'd post it here for others.\nA WSDL document defines services as collections of network endpoints, or ports. In WSDL, the abstract definition of endpoints and messages is separated from their concrete network deployment or data format bindings. This allows the reuse of abstract definitions: messages, which are abstract descriptions of the data being exchanged, and port types which are abstract collections of operations. The concrete protocol and data format specifications for a particular port type constitutes a reusable binding. A port is defined by associating a network address with a reusable binding, and a collection of ports define a service. Hence, a WSDL document uses the following elements in the definition of network services:\n\nTypes\u2013 a container for data type definitions using some type system (such as XSD).\nMessage\u2013 an abstract, typed definition of the data being communicated.\nOperation\u2013 an abstract description of an action supported by the service.\nPort Type\u2013an abstract set of operations supported by one or more endpoints.\nBinding\u2013 a concrete protocol and data format specification for a particular port type.\nPort\u2013 a single endpoint defined as a combination of a binding and a network address.\nService\u2013 a collection of related endpoints.\n\n", 'questionId': '11561', 'answerId': '11639'}
{'answer': u"That is not as easy as it sounds.  Java is platform independent, so I am not sure how to do it in Java.  I am guessing that .NET contacts some web site which reports it back.  There are a couple ways to go.  First, a deeper look into the ICMP protocol may give you the information you need.  You can also trace the IP you go through (your route).  When you encounter an IP that is not in the following ranges:\n\n10.0.0.0 \u2013 10.255.255.255\n172.16.0.0 \u2013 172.31.255.255\n192.168.0.0 \u2013 192.168.255.255\n\nit is the IP one hop away from yours, and probably shares a few octets of information with your IP.\nBest of luck.

{'answer': u'You may be better off using something like checkmyip.org, which will determine your public IP address - not necessarily your first hop router: at Uni I have a "real" IP address, whereas at home it is my local router\'s public IP address.\nYou can parse the page that returns, or find another site that allows you to just get the IP address back as the only string.\n(I\'m meaning load this URL in Java/whatever, and then get the info you need).\nThis should be totally platform independent.\n', 'questionId': '11930', 'answerId': '12013'}

{'answer': u"I guess it really comes down to what your Java code is for, how it's distributed and who your clients are.

{'answer': u"I use proguard for JavaME development. It's not only very very good at making jar files smaller (Essential for mobile) but it is useful as a nicer way of doing device-specific code without resorting to IDE-unfriendly preprocessing tools such as antenna.\nE.g.\n\nThis gets compiled, obfuscated, and the class file ends up as though you had written:\n\nSo you can have variants of code to work around manufacturer bugs in JVM/library implementations without bulking out the final executable class files.\nI believe that some commercial obfuscators can also merge class files together in certain cases. This is useful because the more classes you have, the larger the size overhead you have in the zip (jar) file.\n", 'questionId': '12088', 'answerId': '12100'}
{'answer': u'If you do obfuscate, stay away from obfuscators that modify the code by changing code flow and/or adding exception blocks and such to make it hard to disassemble it. To make the code unreadable it is usually enough to just change all names of methods, fields and classes.\nThe reason to stay away from changing code flow is that some of those changes makes it impossible for the JVM to efficiently optimize the code.

{'answer': u"As far as I know, the Windows registry is no longer the preferred way of storing configuration if you are using .NET - most applications now make use of System.Configuration [1, 2]. Since this is also XML based it seems to be that everything is moving in the direction of using XML for configuration.\nIf you want to stay cross-platform I would say that using some sort of a text file would be the best route to go. As for the formatting of said file, you might want to take into account if a human is going to be manipulating it or not. XML seems to be a bit more friendly to manual manipulation than INI files due to the visible structure of the file.\nAs for the angle bracket tax - I don't worry about it too often as the XML libraries take care of abstracting it.

{'answer': u'Without starting a new holy war, the sentiments of the \'angle bracket tax\' post is one area where I majorly disagree with Jeff. There\'s nothing wrong with XML, it\'s reasonably human readable (as much as YAML or JSON or INI files are) but remember its intent is to be read by machines. Most language/framework combos come with an XML parser of some sort for free which makes XML a pretty good choice. \nAlso, if you\'re using a good IDE like Visual Studio, and if the XML comes with a schema, you can give the schema to VS and magically you get intellisense (you can get one for NHibernate for example).\nUlimately you need to think about how often you\'re going to be touching these files once in production, probably not that often.\nThis still says it all for me about XML and why it\'s still a valid choice for config files (from Tim Bray):\n"If you want to provide general-purpose data that the receiver might want to do unforeseen weird and crazy things with, or if you want to be really paranoid and picky about i18n, or if what you\u2019re sending is more like a document than a struct, or if the order of the data matters, or if the data is potentially long-lived (as in, more than seconds) XML is the way to go. \nIt also seems to me that the combination of XML and XPath hits a sweet spot for data formats that need to be extensible; that is to say, it\u2019s pretty easy to write XML-processing code that won\u2019t fail in the presence of changes to the message format that don\u2019t touch the piece you care about."\n', 'questionId': '12144', 'answerId': '12184'}

There's no good way (imho) to do that with plain old key/value pairs.\nIf your app's config is simple, then something simple like an INI file that's read into a dictionary is probably fine.

I\'m not against hardcoding this data in your source files but, as you noticed, Java can be pretty wordy when it comes to nested Collections.  Your file might looks like:\n\nA.Summer=M\n  A.Spring=tTS\n  B.Summer=T\n\nUsually I don\'t like to move static data like this to an external file because it increases the "distance" between the data and the code that uses it.

{'answer': u"I'm totally at a loss as to why some of you seem to think that throwing gobs of objects at the code is the way to go.  For example, there are exactly four seasons, and they don't do or store anything.  How does it simplify anything to make them objects?  Wing is quite right that these should probably be constants (or maybe enums).\nWhat Bruce needs, at it's heart, is simply a lookup table.  He doesn't need a hierarchy of objects and interfaces; he needs a way to look up a schedule based on a season and a group identifier.  Turning things into objects only makes sense if they have responsibilities or state.  If they have neither, then they are simply identifiers, and building special objects for them just makes the codebase larger.\nYou could build, e.g., Group objects that each contain a set of schedule strings (one for each season), but if all the Group object does is provide lookup functionality, then you've reinvented the lookup table in a much less intuitive fashion.  If he has to look up the group, and then lookup the schedule, all he has is a two-step lookup table that took longer to code, is more likely to be buggy, and will be harder to maintain.\n", 'questionId': '12870', 'answerId': '12941'}

Particularly in the Java space, you should find plenty of mentors/resources on working out your application with Objects, not a database-centric approach.  Database design is typically the first step for Microsoft folks (which I do daily, but am in a recovery program, er, Alt.Net).

{'answer': u"The main thing is being able to abstract the complexity of the system so that you don't get bogged down by it as soon as you start off.\n\nFirst read the spec like a story (skimming through it). Don't stop at every requirement to analyze it right there and then. This will allow you to get an overall picture of the system without too many details. At this point you would start identifying the major functional components of the system. Start putting these down (use a mindmap tool if you like).\nThen take each component and start exploding it (and tying each detail with requirements in the spec document). Do this for all components, till you have covered all requirements.\nNow, you should start looking at relationships between the components, and whether there are repetitions of features or functions across the various components (which you can then pull out to create utility components, or such). Around now, you would have a good detailed map of your requirements in your mind.\nNOW, you should think of designing the database, ER diagrams, Class Design, DFDs, deployment, etc.\n\nThe problem with doing the last step first is that you can get bogged down in the complexity of your system without really gaining an overall understanding in the first place.\n", 'questionId': '15690', 'answerId': '15783'}

{'answer': u"This sounds very much like my first job. Straight out of university, I was asked to design the database and business logic layer, while other people would take care of the UI. Meanwhile the boss was looking over my shoulder, unwilling to let go of what used to be his baby and was now mine, and poking his finger in it. Three years later, developers were fleeing the company and we were still X months away from actually selling anything.\nThe big mistake was in being too ambitious. If this is your first job, you will make mistakes and you will need to change how things work long after you've written them. We had all sorts of features that made the system more complicated than it needed to be, both on the database level and in the API that it presented to other developers. In the end, the whole thing was just far too complicated to support all at once and just died.\nSo my advice:\n\nIf you're not sure about taking on such a big job single-handed, don't. Tell your employers, and get them to find or hire somebody for you to work with who can help you out. If people need to be added to the project, then it should be done near the start rather than after stuff starts going wrong.\nThink very carefully about what the product is for, and to boil it down to the simplest set of requirements you can think of.

Talk to customers and salespeople, and understand the market.\nThere's no shame in admitting you're wrong. If it turns out that the entire system needs to be rewritten, because you made some mistake in your first version, then it's better to admit this as soon as possible so you can get to it. Correspondingly, don't try to make an architecture that can anticipate every possible contingency in your first version, because you don't know what every contingency is and will just get it wrong.

To quote the API for Map:\n\nNote: great care must be exercised if\n  mutable objects are used as map keys.\n  The behavior of a map is not specified\n  if the value of an object is changed\n  in a manner that affects equals\n  comparisons while the object is a key\n  in the map.\n\n", 'questionId': '16557', 'answerId': '16573'}

{'answer': u'I would highly recommend picking up a copy of Effective Java and reading through item 7 obeying the equals contract. You need to be careful if you are overriding equals for mutable objects, as many of the collections such as Maps and Sets use equals to determine equivalence, and mutating an object contained in a collection could lead to unexpected results. Brian Goetz also has a pretty good overview of implementing equals and hashCode.\n', 'questionId': '16557', 'answerId': '16591'}
{'answer': u'You should "never" override equals & getHashCode for mutable objects - this goes for .net and Java both. If you do, and use such an object as the key in f.ex a dictionary and then change that object, you\'ll be in trouble because the dictionary relies on the hashcode to find the object.\nHere\'s a good article on the topic: http://weblogs.asp.net/bleroy/archive/2004/12/15/316601.aspx\n', 'questionId': '16557', 'answerId': '16601'}

{'answer': u'To be honest, in Java there is not really an argument against overriding equals.  If you need to compare instances for equality, then that is what you do.  \nAs mentioned above, you need to be aware of the contract with hashCode, and similarly, watch out for the gotchas around the Comparable interface - in almost all situations you want the natural ordering as defined by Comparable to be consistent with equals (see the BigDecimal api doc for the canonical counter example)\nCreating a new method for deciding equality, quite apart from not working with the existing library classes, flies in the face of Java convention somewhat.\n', 'questionId': '16557', 'answerId': '16816'}
{'answer': u'Well, since you can not have one part OSGi and one part non-OSGi you\'ll need to make your entire app OSGi. In its simplest form you make a single OSGi bundle out of your entire application. Clearly this is not a best practice but it can be useful to get a feel for deploying a bundle in an OSGi container (Equinox, Felix, Knoplerfish, etc).\nTo take it to the next level you\'ll want to start splitting your app into components, components should typically have a set of responsibilities that can be isolated from the rest of your application through a set of interfaces and class dependencies. Identifying these purely by hand can range from rather straightforward for a well designed highly cohesive but loosely coupled application to a nightmare for interlocked source code that you are not familiar with.\nSome help can come from tools like JDepend which can show you the coupling of Java packages against other packages/classes in your system. A package with low efferent coupling should be easier to extract into an OSGi bundle than one with high efferent coupling. Even more architectural insight can be had with pro tools like Structure 101.\nPurely on a technical level, working daily with an application that consists of 160 OSGi bundles and using Spring DM I can confirm that the transition from "normal" Spring to Spring DM is largely pain free. The extra namespace and the fact that you can (and should) isolate your OSGi specific Spring configuration in separate files makes it even easier to have both with and without OSGi deployment scenarios.\nOSGi is a deep and wide component model, documentation I recommend:\n\nOSGi R4 Specification: Get the PDFs of the Core and Compendium specification, they are canonical, authoritative and very readable. Have a shortcut to them handy at all times, you will consult them.\nRead up on OSGi best practices, there is a large set of things you can do but a somewhat smaller set of things you should do and there are some things you should never do (DynamicImport: * for example). \n\nSome links: \n\nOSGi best practices and using Apache Felix\nPeter Kriens and BJ Hargrave in a Sun presentation on OSGi best practices \none key OSGi concept are Services, learn why and how they supplant the Listener pattern with the Whiteboard pattern\nThe Spring DM Google Group is very responsive and friendly in my experience\nThe Spring DM Google Group is no longer active and has moved to Eclipse.org as the Gemini Blueprint project which has a forum here.\n\n', 'questionId': '16140', 'answerId': '16817'}

To add some thing to the body of the email it is again as simple as above - '?body=' after the email address. However formatting that email can be a little tricky. To create spaces between words you will have to use hex code - for example '%20' between each word, and to create new lines will mean adding '%0D'. Similarly symbols such as $ signs will need to be written in hex code.\nIf you also wish to add a subject line and send copies to multiple recipients, this can make for a very long and difficult to write bit of code. \nIt will send a message to three people, with the subject and the message filled in, all you need to do is add your name. \nJust look at the code! \n\nNote: Original source URL where I found this is now 404ing so I grabbed to content from waybackmachine and posted it here so it doesn't get lost.

For each field the comparison goes like this:\n\nThe result of this comparison is "anded" (&&) with the result of the comparison of the next field, and so on. The class goes on with a hashCode method that also uses all fields, some custom XML serialization methods and a method that returns a Axis-specific metadata object that describes the class and that also uses all field members.\nThis class is never modified, so I just put a compiled version in the application classpath and the project compiled without issues. \nNow, I know that removing this single source file solved the problem. However, I have absolutely no idea as to why this particular class caused the problem. It will be nice to know; what can cause or causes a StackOverflowError during compilation of Java code? I think I\'ll post that question.\nFor those interested:\n\nWindows XP SP2\nSUN\'s JDK 1.4.2_17\nAnt 1.7.0\n\n', 'questionId': '16935', 'answerId': '18086'}

{'answer': u'@Jonathan: I could be mistaken, but I believe that String.valueOf() in this case will call the String.valueOf(Object) function rather than getting boxed to String.valueOf(int).  String.valueOf(Object) just returns "null" if it is null or calls Object.toString() if non-null, which shouldn\'t involve boxing (although obviously instantiating new string objects is involved).\n', 'questionId': '18524', 'answerId': '18547'}

{'answer': u'You can\'t avoid the "boxing overhead"; Java\'s faux generic containers can only store Objects, so your ints must be boxed into Integers.  In principle it could avoid the downcast from Object to Integer (since it\'s pointless, because Object is good enough for both String.valueOf and Object.toString) but I don\'t know if the compiler is smart enough to do that.

Yes they cost money, and using them can occasionally be a bit awkward, but they do provide you with a great deal more real evidence rather than guesswork.\nHuman beings are universally bad at guessing where performance bottlenecks are.

It may seem obvious, you may have great ideas about what the problem is, but the real world often turns out to be doing something different.

You might want to throw individual exceptions in cases like \n\nThe application is high availability \nSending e-mail is particularly important \nThe scope of the application is small and sending e-mail is a large part of it\nThe application will be deployed to a site which is remote and you will only get logs for debugging\nYou can recover from some subset of the exceptions encapsulated in the mailException but not others\n\nIn most cases I would say just log the text of the exception and don't waste your time granularizing already pretty granular exceptions.  \n", 'questionId': '21652', 'answerId': '21667'}
{'answer': u"In my code, I find that MOST exceptions percolate up to a UI layer where they are caught by my exception handlers which simply display a message to the user (and write to the log). It's an unexpected exception, after all.\nSometimes, I do want to catch a specific exception (as you seem to want to do). You'll probably find, however, that this is somewhat rare and that it is indicative of using exceptions to control logic -- which is inefficient (slow) and often frowned upon.\nSo using your example, if you want to run some special logic when the email server is not configured, you may want to add a method to the emailUtil object like:\npublic bool isEmailConfigured()\n... call that first, instead of looking for a specific exception.\nWhen an exception does happen, it really means that the situation was completely unexpected and the code can't handle it -- so the best you can do is report it to the user (or write it to a log or restart )\nAs for having an exception hierarchy vs exceptions-with-error-codes-in-them, I typically do the latter. It's easier to add new exceptions, if you just need to define a new error constant instead of a whole new class. But, it doesn't matter much as long as you try to be consistent throughout your project.\n", 'questionId': '21652', 'answerId': '21678'}
{'answer': u'Instead of using exceptions, I tend to return a list of status objects from methods that may have problems executing.  The status objects contain a severity enum (information, warning, error, ...) a status object name like "Email Address" and a user readable message like "Badly formatted Email Address"\nThe calling code would then decide which to filter up to the UI and which to handle itself.\nPersonally, I think exceptions are strictly for when you can\'t implement a normal code solution.  The performance hit and handling restrictions are just a bit too much for me.\nAnother reason for using a list of status objects is that identifying multiple errors (such as during validation) is MUCH easier.  After all, you can only throw one exception which must be handled before moving on.  \nImagine a user submitting an email that had a malformed destination address and contained language that you are blocking.  Do you throw the malformed email exception, then, after they fix that and resubmit, throw a bad language exception?  From a user experience perspective dealing with all of them at once is a better way to go.\nUPDATE: combining answers\n@Jonathan: My point was that I can evaluate the action, in this case sending an email, and send back multiple failure reasons. For example, "bad email address", "blank message title", etc..\nWith an exception, you\'re limited to just percolating the one problem then asking the user to resubmit at which point they find out about a second problem. This is really bad UI design.\nReinventing the wheel.. possibly. However, most applications should analyze the whole transaction in order to give the best possible information to the user. Imagine if your compiler stopped dead at the first error. You then fix the error and hit compile again only to have it stop again for a different error. What a pain in the butt. To me, that\'s exactly the problem with throwing exceptions and hence the reason I said to use a different mechanism.\n', 'questionId': '21652', 'answerId': '21777'}

{'answer': u"Static methods are not instance methods. There's no instance context, therefore to implement it from the interface makes little sense.\n", 'questionId': '21817', 'answerId': '21819'}
{'answer': u"I'll answer your question with an example. Suppose we had a Math class with a static method add. You would call this method like so:\n\nIf Math were an interface instead of a class, it could not have any defined functions. As such, saying something like Math.add(2, 3) makes no sense.\n", 'questionId': '21817', 'answerId': '21823'}
{'answer': u"The reason why you can't have a static method in an interface lies in the way Java resolves static references. Java will not bother looking for an instance of a class when attempting to execute a static method. This is because static methods are not instance dependent and hence can be executed straight from the class file. Given that all methods in an interface are abstract, the VM would have to look for a particular implementation of the interface in order to find the code behind the static method so that it could be executed. This then contradicts how static method resolution works and would introduce an inconsistency into the language.\n", 'questionId': '21817', 'answerId': '21826'}

{'answer': u"There are drawbacks of using reference counting. One of the most mentioned is circular references: Suppose A references B, B references C and C references B. If A were to drop its reference to B, both B and C will still have a reference count of 1 and won't be deleted with traditional reference counting. CPython (reference counting is not part of python itself, but part of the C implementation thereof) catches circular references with a separate garbage collection routine that it runs periodically...\nAnother drawback: Reference counting can make execution slower. Each time an object is referenced and dereferenced, the interpreter/VM must check to see if the count has gone down to 0 (and then deallocate if it did). Garbage Collection does not need to do this.\nAlso, Garbage Collection can be done in a separate thread (though it can be a bit tricky). On machines with lots of RAM and for processes that use memory only slowly, you might not want to be doing GC at all! Reference counting would be a bit of a drawback there in terms of performance...\n", 'questionId': '21934', 'answerId': '21964'}

{'answer': u"Darren Thomas gives a good answer.  However, one big difference between the Java and Python approaches is that with reference counting in the common case (no circular references) objects are cleaned up immediately rather than at some indeterminate later date.\nFor example, I can write sloppy, non-portable code in CPython such as\n\nand the file descriptor for that file I opened will be cleaned up immediately because as soon as the reference to the open file goes away, the file is garbage collected and the file descriptor is freed.  Of course, if I run Jython or IronPython or possibly PyPy, then the garbage collector won't necessarily run until much later; possibly I'll run out of file descriptors first and my program will crash.\nSo you SHOULD be writing code that looks like\n\nbut sometimes people like to rely on reference counting to always free up their resources because it can sometimes make your code a little shorter.\nI'd say that the best garbage collector is the one with the best performance, which currently seems to be the Java-style generational garbage collectors that can run in a separate thread and has all these crazy optimizations, etc.  The differences to how you write your code should be negligible and ideally non-existent.\n", 'questionId': '21934', 'answerId': '22219'}

{'answer': u'We run DB40 .NET version in a large client/server project.\nOur experiences is that you can potentially get much better performance than typical relational databases.\nHowever, you really have to tweak your objects to get this kind of performance. For example, if you\'ve got a list containing a lot of objects, DB4O activation of these lists is slow. There are a number of ways to get around this problem, for example, by inverting the relationship.\nAnother pain is activation. When you retrieve or delete an object from DB4O, by default it will activate the whole object tree. For example, loading a Foo will load Foo.Bar.Baz.Bat, etc until there\'s nothing left to load. While this is nice from a programming standpoint, performance will slow down the more nesting in your objects. To improve performance, you can tell DB4O how many levels deep to activate. This is time-consuming to do if you\'ve got a lot of objects.\nAnother area of pain was text searching. DB4O\'s text searching is far, far slower than SQL full text indexing. (They\'ll tell you this outright on their site.) The good news is, it\'s easy to setup a text searching engine on top of DB4O. On our project, we\'ve hooked up Lucene.NET to index the text fields we want.\nSome APIs don\'t seem to work, such as the GetField APIs useful in applying database upgrades. (For example, you\'ve renamed a property and you want to upgrade your existing objects in the database, you need to use these "reflection" APIs to find objects in the database. Other APIs, such as the [Index] attribute don\'t work in the stable 6.4 version, and you must instead specify indexes using the Configure().Index("someField"), which is not strongly typed.\nWe\'ve witnessed performance degrade the larger your database. We have a 1GB database right now and things are still fast, but not nearly as fast as when we started with a tiny database.\nWe\'ve found another issue where Db4O.GetByID will close the database if the ID doesn\'t exist anymore in the database.\nWe\'ve found the Native Query syntax (the most natural, language-integrated syntax for queries) is far, far slower than the less-friendly SODA queries. So instead of typing:\n\nInstead of that nice query code, you have to an ugly SODA query which is string-based and not strongly-typed.\nFor .NET folks, they\'ve recently introduced a LINQ-to-DB4O provider, which provides for the best syntax yet. However, it\'s yet to be seen whether performance will be up-to-par with the ugly SODA queries.\nDB4O support has been decent: we\'ve talked to them on the phone a number of times and have received helpful info. Their user forums are next to worthless, however, almost all questions go unanswered.

In general, though, I\'ve been underwhelmed by most Java web frameworks I\'ve looked at (esp Struts).  \nFor a simple app I\'d definitely consider using "raw" servlets and JSPs and not worry about adopting a framework.  If the servlets are well written, it should be straightforward in the future to port to a framework if necessary when the app grows in complexity.\n', 'questionId': '24596', 'answerId': '24694'}
{'answer': u"I've used Tapestry 3, Wicket, Echo, and JSF fairly extensively.  I'd really recommend you look those over and pick the one that appears the easiest for you, and to most closely fit the way you prefer to work.\nOf them, the most comfortable for me to work with was Wicket, due to the lightweight nature of component building and simplicity of page templating.  That goes doubly so if you are using your own db code instead of Hibernate or some other framework (I was never completely happy with Wicket Hibernate or Spring Integration).\nEcho is great if you don't mind writing all of your layout in Java.  I know that is different now, but I still think that product serves a fairly narrow niche.  They change the development model with every major release as well it seems.\nTapestry is a great product, but it is obviously very different from the others in terms of development model as it is led mainly by one dude.  Howard Lewis Ship is no doubt quite smart, but I am disappointed with their decision to basically forget backwards compatibility with each release.  Again, though, for your needs this may not matter, and I've always found the Tapestry products pleasurable to work against.\nJSF has been out for years, and still feels like something that a Struts guy built to fix all of the problems of Struts.  Without really understanding all of the problems with Struts.  It still has an unfinished feel to it, although the product is obviously very flexible.  I use it and have some fondness for it, with great hopes for its future.  I think the next release (2.0) to be delivered in JEE6 will really bring it into its own, with a new template syntax (similar to Facelets) and a simplified component model (custom components in only 1 file... finally).\nAnd, of course, there are a million smaller frameworks and tools that get their own following (Velocity for basic needs, raw JSPs, Struts, etc).  I generally prefer component oriented frameworks myself, though.  \nIn the end, I'd recommend just taking a look at Tapestry, Wicket, and JSF and just picking the one that feels the best to you.  You'll probably find one that just fits the way you like to work very quickly.\n", 'questionId': '24596', 'answerId': '24707'}

{'answer': u'No - If you can parse it yourself (as you are doing), and it will scale for your needs, you do not need any library.\nJust ensure that your future needs are going to be met - complex xml creation is better done using libraries - some of which come in very simple flavors too.\n', 'questionId': '24866', 'answerId': '24867'}
{'answer': u"I think that custom string manipulation is fine, but you have to keep two things in mind:\n\nYour code isn't as mature as the library. Allocate time in your plan to handle the bugs that pop-up.\nYour approach will probably not scale as well as a 3rd party library when the xml starts to grow (both in terms of performance and ease of use).\n\nI know a code base that uses custom string manipulation for xml output (and a 3rd party library for input). It was fine to begin with but became a real hassle after a while.\n", 'questionId': '24866', 'answerId': '24869'}
{'answer': u'Yes, use the library.\nSomebody took the time and effort to create something that is usually better than what you could come up with. String manipulation is for sending back a single node, but once you start needing to manipulate the DOM, or use an XPath query, the library will save you.\n', 'questionId': '24866', 'answerId': '24872'}
{'answer': u'No - especially for generating (parsing I would be less inclined to as input text can always surprise you). I think its fine - but be prepared to shift to a library should you find yourself spending more then a few minutes maintaining your own code. \n', 'questionId': '24866', 'answerId': '24894'}
{'answer': u"I don't think that using the DOM XML API wich comes with the JDK is difficult, it's easy to create Element nodes, attributes, etc... and later is easy convert strings to a DOM document sor DOM documents into a String\nIn the first page google finds from Spain (spanish XML example):\n\n", 'questionId': '24866', 'answerId': '24897'}
{'answer': u'It\'s not essential, but advisable. However, if string manipulation works for you, then go for it! There are plenty of cases where small or simple XML text can be safely built by hand.\nJust be aware that creating XML text is harder than it looks. Here\'s some criteria I would consider:\n\nFirst: how much control do you have on the information that goes into the xml?\n\nThe less control you have on the source data, the more likely you will have trouble, and the more advantageous the library becomes. For example: (a) Can you guarantee that the element names will never have a character that is illegal in a name? (b) How about quotes in an attribute\'s content? Can they happen, and are you handling them? (c) Does the data ever contain anything that might need to be encoded as an entity (like the less-than which often needs to be output as &lt;); are you doing it correctly?\n\nSecond, maintainability: is the code that builds the XML easy to understand by someone else?\n\nYou probably don\'t want to be stuck with the code for life. I\'ve worked with second-hand C++ code that hand-builds XML and it can be surprisingly obscure. Of course, if this is a personal project of yours, then you don\'t need to worry about "others": substitute "in a year" for "others" above.\nI wouldn\'t worry about performance. If your XML is simple enough that you can hand-write it, any overhead from the library is probably meaningless. Of course, your case might be different, but you should measure to prove it first.\nFinally, Yes; you can hand build XML text by hand if it\'s simple enough; but not knowing the libraries available is probably not the right reason.\nA modern XML library is a quite powerful tool, but it can also be daunting. However, learning the essentials of your XML library is not that hard, and it can be quite handy; among other things, it\'s almost a requisite in today\'s job marketplace. Just don\'t get bogged down by namespaces, schemas and other fancier features until you get the essentials.\nGood luck.\n', 'questionId': '24866', 'answerId': '24902'}
{'answer': u"Xml is hard. Parsing yourself is a bad idea, it's even a worse idea to generate content yourself.

{'answer': u"It was quite some time since I dug into those parts of Java, but...\nWhy you can't do it was probably a design choice by the language developers. Still, due to the type erasure employed by Java, the generics information gets dropped at compile time anyway, so in your example it would create exactly the same byte code whether you had the type parameter or not.\n", 'questionId': '24991', 'answerId': '24996'}
{'answer': u"You can, if you pass in the type as a method parameter.\n\nMethods cannot be genericised in the same way that a type can, so the only option for a method with a dynamically-typed generic return type -- phew that's a mouthful :-) -- is to pass in the type as an argument.\nFor a truly excellent FAQ on Java generics, see Angelika Langer's generics FAQ.\n.\n.   \nFollow-up:\nIt wouldn't make sense in this context to use the array argument as in Collection.toArray( T[] ). The only reason an array is used there is because the same (pre-allocated) array is used to contain the results (if the array is large enough to fit them all in). This saves on allocating a new array at run-time all the time.\nHowever, for the purposes of education, if you did want to use the array typing, the syntax is very similar:\n\n", 'questionId': '24991', 'answerId': '24997'}
{'answer': u"@pauldoo\nYes, you are quite right. It is one of the weaknesses with the java generics imho.\nI response to Cheekysoft I'd like to propose to also look at how it is done by the Java people themselves, such as T[] AbstractCollection#toArray(T[] a). I think Cheekysofts version is superior, but the Java one has the advantage of familiarity.\nEdit: Added link.\nRe-edit: Found a bug on SO :)\n\nFollow-up on Cheekysoft:\nWell, as it is a list of some type that should be returned the corresponding example should look something like:\n\nBut yes, passing the class object is clearly the better one.

{'answer': u'No input is not the same as the end of the stream. You can usually simulate the end of the stream in a console by pressing Ctrl+D (AFAIK some systems use Ctrl+Z instead). But I guess this is not what you want so better test for empty strings additionally to null strings.\n', 'questionId': '25033', 'answerId': '25036'}
{'answer': u"\nFrom my understanding of this, readLine should return null the first time no input is entered other than a line termination, like '\\r'.\n\nThat is not correct. readLine will return null if the end of the stream is reached. That is, for example, if you are reading a file, and the file ends, or if you're reading from a socket and the socket closses.\nBut if you're simply reading the console input, hitting the return key on your keyboard does not constitute an end of stream. It's simply a character that is returned (\\n or \\r\\n depending on your OS).\nSo, if you want to break on both the empty string and the end of line, you should do:\n\nAlso, your current program should work as expected if you pipe some file directly into it, like so:\n\n", 'questionId': '25033', 'answerId': '25043'}
{'answer': u'I normally try the constructor to do nothing but getting the dependencies and initializing the related instance members with them.

{'answer': u'In C# it doesn\'t matter. The two code samples you give are utterly equivalent. In the first example the C# compiler (or is it the CLR?) will construct an empty constructor and initialise the variables as if they were in the constructor.\nIf there is already a constructor then any initialisation "above" will be moved into the top of it.\nIn terms of best practice the former is less error prone than the latter as someone could easily add another constructor and forget to chain it.\n', 'questionId': '24551', 'answerId': '25130'}
{'answer': u"By not using a library, you risk generating or parsing data that isn't well-formed, which sooner or later will happen. For the same reason document.write isn't allowed in XHTML, you shouldn't write your XML markup as a string.\n", 'questionId': '24866', 'answerId': '25187'}

{'answer': u"First, the equivalent of ASP.Net in Java is going to be a web framework, such as the ones you mention (Tiles, Tapestry and Velocity).\nMaster pages give the ability to define pages in terms of content slotted into a master template.\nMaster pages are a feature of ASP.Net (the .Net web framework), so you are looking for a feature similar to master pages in a Java web framework.  \nhttp://tiles.apache.org/framework/tutorial/basic/pages.html gives some basic examples using Tiles and JSP to implement something similar with Struts, a Java web framework.  In this case, the Master Pages functionality is a plugin on top of Struts.\nVelocity is a generic templating engine, not specialized for web pages and definitely more complicated than you need.  (I've seen it used for code generation.)\nTapestry is more of a full featured web stack than Tile, and is probably good for your purposes.  Its templating functionality involves creating a component and putting all common markup in that.

{'answer': u"Basically, each job deserves an own exception. When you catch exceptions, you don't distinguish different instances, like you would normally do with objects, therefore you need different subtypes. Using too many custom exceptions is a case which I see hardly occurring.\nOne advice would be to create exceptions as needed, and if it becomes apparent that one exception type is a duplicate of another, refactor the code by merging the two. Of course it helps if some thought goes into structuring exceptions from the beginning. But generally, use custom exceptions for all cases that have no 1:1 correspondence to existing, situation-specific exceptions.\nOn the other hand, NullPointerExceptions and IndexOutofBoundsExceptions might actually often be appropriate. Don't catch these, though (except for logging) as they're a programming error which means that after throwing them, the program is in an undefined state.\n", 'questionId': '26984', 'answerId': '27000'}
{'answer': u'My rule of thumb is when the client (the caller) might reasonably want to do something different, depending on the type of exception thrown, the additional exception types are warranted.

I personally tend to only show a informational message to the user if a certain type of exception is thrown (UserException in my app). Of course you should scrub and verify user input as much as possible further up the stack to make sure any exceptions are generated by truly unlikely scenarios, not as a filter for malformed emails which can easily be checked with a regex.\nI also wouldn't worry about the performance implications of catching an exception from user input.

{'answer': u"From A Java Learner:\n\nWhen an exception occurs, you have to\n  either catch and handle the exception,\n  or tell compiler that you can't handle\n  it by declaring that your method\n  throws that exception, then the code\n  that uses your method will have to\n  handle that exception (even it also\n  may choose to declare that it throws\n  the exception if it can't handle it). \nCompiler will check that we have done\n  one of the two things (catch, or\n  declare).  So these are called Checked\n  exceptions.   But Errors, and Runtime\n  Exceptions are not checked for by\n  compiler (even though you can choose\n  to catch, or declare, it is not\n  required).  So, these two are called\n  Unchecked exceptions.\nErrors are used to represent those\n  conditions which occur outside the\n  application, such as crash of the\n  system.  Runtime exceptions are\n  usually occur by fault in the\n  application logic.  You can't do\n  anything in these situations.  When\n  runtime exception occur, you have to\n  re-write your program code.  So, these\n  are not  checked by compiler.

{'answer': u'The theory (for the language lawyers and the mathematically inclined):\nequals() (javadoc) must define an equivalence relation (it must be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive).

Furthermore, o.equals(null) must always return false.\nhashCode() (javadoc) must also be consistent (if the object is not modified in terms of equals(), it must keep returning the same value).\nThe relation between the two methods is:\n\nWhenever a.equals(b), then a.hashCode() must be same as b.hashCode().\n\nIn practice:\nIf you override one, then you should override the other.\nUse the same set of fields that you use to compute equals() to compute hashCode().\nUse the excellent helper classes EqualsBuilder and HashCodeBuilder from the Apache Commons Lang library. An example:\n\nAlso remember:\nWhen using a hash-based Collection or Map such as HashSet, LinkedHashSet, HashMap, Hashtable, or WeakHashMap, make sure that the hashCode() of the key objects that you put into the collection never changes while the object is in the collection.

{'answer': u"Assuming finalizers are similar to their .NET namesake then you only really need to call these when you have resources such as file handles that can leak. Most of the time your objects don't have these references so they don't need to be called.\nIt's bad to try to collect the garbage because it's not really your garbage. You have told the VM to allocate some memory when you created objects, and the garbage collector is hiding information about those objects. Internally the GC is performing optimisations on the memory allocations it makes. When you manually try to collect the garbage you have no knowledge about what the GC wants to hold onto and get rid of, you are just forcing it's hand. As a result you mess up internal calculations.\nIf you knew more about what the GC was holding internally then you might be able to make more informed decisions, but then you've missed the benefits of GC.\n", 'questionId': '28949', 'answerId': '28976'}

{'answer': u"The short answer: Java garbage collection is a very finely tuned tool. System.gc() is a sledge-hammer.\nJava's heap is divided into different generations, each of which is collected using a different strategy. If you attach a profiler to a healthy app, you'll see that it very rarely has to run the most expensive kinds of collections because most objects are caught by the faster copying collector in the young generation.\nCalling System.gc() directly, while technically not guaranteed to do anything, in practice will trigger an expensive, stop-the-world full heap collection. This is almost always the wrong thing to do. You think you're saving resources, but you're actually wasting them for no good reason, forcing Java to recheck all your live objects \u201cjust in case\u201d.\nIf you are having problems with GC pauses during critical moments, you're better off configuring the JVM to use the concurrent mark/sweep collector, which was designed specifically to minimise time spent paused, than trying to take a sledgehammer to the problem and just breaking it further.\nThe Sun document you were thinking of is here: Java SE 6 HotSpot\u2122 Virtual Machine Garbage Collection Tuning\n(Another thing you might not know: implementing a finalize() method on your object makes garbage collection slower. Firstly, it will take two GC runs to collect the object: one to run finalize() and the next to ensure that the object wasn't resurrected during finalization. Secondly, objects with finalize() methods have to be treated as special cases by the GC because they have to be collected individually, they can't just be thrown away in bulk.)\n", 'questionId': '28949', 'answerId': '29038'}
{'answer': u"Don't bother with finalizers.  \nSwitch to incremental garbage collection.\nIf you want to help the garbage collector, null off references to objects you no longer need. Less path to follow= more explicitly garbage.\nDon't forget that (non-static) inner class instances keep references to their parent class instance. So an inner class thread keeps a lot more baggage than you might expect.\nIn a very related vein, if you're using serialization, and you've serialized temporary objects, you're going to need to clear the serialization caches, by calling ObjectOutputStream.reset()  or your process will leak memory and eventually die.\nDownside is that non-transient objects are going to get re-serialized.\nSerializing temporary result objects can be a bit more messy than you might think!\nConsider using soft references. If you don't know what soft references are, have a read of the javadoc for java.lang.ref.SoftReference\nSteer clear of Phantom references and Weak references unless you really get excitable.\nFinally, if you really can't tolerate the GC use Realtime Java. \nNo, I'm not joking.\nThe reference implementation is free to download and Peter Dibbles book from SUN is really good reading.\n", 'questionId': '28949', 'answerId': '29138'}

{'answer': u'Generally, no.\nThe stream format for Java serialization is defined in this document, but you need access to the original class definitions (and a Java runtime to load them into) to turn the stream data back into something approaching the original objects. For example, classes may define writeObject() and readObject() methods to customise their own serialized form.\n(edit: lubos hasko suggests having a little java program to deserialize the objects in front of Python, but the problem is that for this to work, your "little java program" needs to load the same versions of all the same classes that it might deserialize. Which is tricky if you\'re receiving log messages from one app, and really tricky if you\'re multiplexing more than one log stream. Either way, it\'s not going to be a little program any more. edit2: I could be wrong here, I don\'t know what gets serialized. If it\'s just log4j classes you should be fine. On the other hand, it\'s possible to log arbitrary exceptions, and if they get put in the stream as well my point stands.)\nIt would be much easier to customise the log4j network adapter and replace the raw serialization with some more easily-deserialized form (for example you could use XStream to turn the object into an XML representation)\n', 'questionId': '29505', 'answerId': '29524'}

I\'m just giving general advice here that is applicable to any pair of languages (name of the question is pretty language agnostic so I just provided one of the generic solutions).

{'answer': u'Theoretically, it\'s possible. The Java Serialization, like pretty much everything in Javaland, is standardized. So, you could implement a deserializer according to that standard in Python. However, the Java Serialization format is not designed for cross-language use, the serialization format is closely tied to the way objects are represented inside the JVM. While implementing a JVM in Python is surely a fun exercise, it\'s probably not what you\'re looking for (-:\nThere are other (data) serialization formats that are specifically designed to be language agnostic. They usually work by stripping the data formats down to the bare minimum (number, string, sequence, dictionary and that\'s it) and thus requiring a bit of work on both ends to represent a rich object as a graph of dumb data structures (and vice versa).\nTwo examples are JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and YAML (YAML Ain\'t Markup Language).\nASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) is another data serialization format. Instead of dumbing the format down to a point where it can be easily understood, ASN.1 is self-describing, meaning all the information needed to decode a stream is encoded within the stream itself.\nAnd, of course, XML (eXtensible Markup Language), will work too, provided that it is not just used to provide textual representation of a "memory dump" of a Java object, but an actual abstract, language-agnostic encoding.\nSo, to make a long story short: your best bet is to either try to coerce log4j into logging in one of the above-mentioned formats, replace log4j with something that does that or try to somehow intercept the objects before they are sent over the wire and convert them before leaving Javaland.\nLibraries that implement JSON, YAML, ASN.1 and XML are available for both Java and Python (and pretty much every programming language known to man).\n', 'questionId': '29505', 'answerId': '29564'}

{'answer': u'Avoid finalizers.  There is no guarantee that they will be called in a timely fashion.  It could take quite a long time before the Memory Management system (i.e., the garbage collector) decides to collect an object with a finalizer.  \nMany people use finalizers to do things like close socket connections or delete temporary files.  By doing so you make your application behaviour unpredictable and tied to when the JVM is going to GC your object.  This can lead to "out of memory" scenarios, not due to the Java Heap being exhausted, but rather due to the system running out of handles for a particular resource.\nOne other thing to keep in mind is that introducing the calls to System.gc() or such hammers may show good results in your environment, but they won\'t necessarily translate to other systems.  Not everyone runs the same JVM, there are many, SUN, IBM J9, BEA JRockit, Harmony, OpenJDK, etc...

The garbage collector takes great care to guarantee that it will never call finalize() more than once on the same object.  With well-written objects, it won't matter, but with poorly written objects, calling finalize multiple times can cause problems (e.g. double release of a native resource ... crash).\nEvery object that has a finalize() method should also provide a close() (or similar) method.

{'answer': u'The literal answer is no - there is never anything "inherently wrong" with code, it\'s a matter of whether it meets the requirements - which may or may not include being maintainable, secure, robust or fast.\nThe code you are running is actually a JET query purely within Access - the Java code is doing nothing except telling Access to run the query.\nOn the one hand, if it ain\'t broke don\'t fix it. On the other hand, there\'s a good chance it will break in the near future so you could try fixing it in advance.\nThe two likely reasons it might break are:\n\nSQL injection risk. Depending on where csvDirPath and csvFileName come from (e.g. csvFileName might come from the name of the file uploaded by a user?), and on how clever the Access JDBC driver is, you could be open to someone breaking or deleting your data by inserting a semicolon (or some brackets to make a subquery) and some additional SQL commands into the query.\nYou are relying on the columns of the CSV file being compatible with the columns of the Access table. If you have unchecked CSV being uploaded, or if the CSV generator has a particular way of handling nulls, or if you one day get an unusual date or number format, you may get an error on inserting into the Access table.\n\nHaving said all that, we are all about pragmatism here. If the above code is from a utility class which you are going to use by hand a few times a week/month/year/ever, then it isn\'t really a problem.\nIf it is a class which forms part of a web application, then the \'official\' Java way to do it would be to read records out of the CSV file (either using a CSV parser or a CSV/text JDBC driver), get the columns out of the recordset, do some validation or sanity checking on them, and then use a new PreparedStatement to insert them into the Access database. Much more trouble but much more robust.\nYou can probably find a combination of tools (e.g. object-relational layers or other data access tools) which will do a lot of that for you, but setting up the tools is going to be as much hassle as writing the code. Then again, you\'ll learn a lot from either one.\n', 'questionId': '30696', 'answerId': '30720'}

{'answer': u"I use to be a fan of the Java (and worse C#) practice of making getters and setters (get set properties) throughout an object.

There are times you can't get away from this (OR/M comes to mind), but in general the object should be set up and then perform its function.  My dream objects tend to have one or two constructors, and maybe a half dozen functions that do work.\nThe reason for this is that once I started developing API's there is a real need to keep things simple.

{'answer': u'C++ templates are actually much more powerful than their C# and Java counterparts as they are evaluated at compile time and support specialization. This allows for Template Meta-Programming and makes the C++ compiler equivalent to a Turing machine (i.e. during the compilation process you can compute anything that is computable with a Turing machine).\n', 'questionId': '31693', 'answerId': '31721'}
{'answer': u"C++ rarely uses the \u201cgenerics\u201d terminology. Instead, the word \u201ctemplates\u201d is used and is more accurate. Templates describes one technique to achieve a generic design.\nC++ templates is very different from what both C# and Java implement for two main reasons. The first reason is that C++ templates don't only allow compile-time type arguments but also compile-time const-value arguments: templates can be given as integers or even function signatures. This means that you can do some quite funky stuff at compile time, e.g. calculations:\n\nThis code also uses the other distinguished feature of C++ templates, namely template specialization. The code defines one class template, product that has one value argument. It also defines a specialization for that template that is used whenever the argument evaluates to 1. This allows me to define a recursion over template definitions. I believe that this was first discovered by Andrei Alexandrescu.\nTemplate specialization is important for C++ because it allows for structural differences in data structures. Templates as a whole is a means of unifying an interface across types. However, although this is desirable, all types cannot be treated equally inside the implementation. C++ templates takes this into account. This is very much the same difference that OOP makes between interface and implementation with the overriding of virtual methods.\nC++ templates are essential for its algorithmic programming paradigm. For example, almost all algorithms for containers are defined as functions that accept the container type as a template type and treat them uniformly. Actually, that's not quite right: C++ doesn't work on containers but rather on ranges that are defined by two iterators, pointing to the beginning and behind the end of the container. Thus, the whole content is circumscribed by the iterators: begin <= elements < end.\nUsing iterators instead of containers is useful because it allows to operate on parts of a container instead of on the whole.\nAnother distinguishing feature of C++ is the possibility of partial specialization for class templates. This is somewhat related to pattern matching on arguments in Haskell and other functional languages. For example, let's consider a class that stores elements:\n\nThis works for any element type. But let's say that we can store pointers more effciently than other types by applying some special trick. We can do this by partially specializing for all pointer types:\n\nNow, whenever we instance a container template for one type, the appropriate definition is used:\n\n", 'questionId': '31693', 'answerId': '31758'}

{'answer': u"Follow-up to my previous posting.\nTemplates are one of the main reasons why C++ fails so abysmally at intellisense, regardless of the IDE used. Because of template specialization, the IDE can never be really sure if a given member exists or not. Consider:\n\nNow, the cursor is at the indicated position and it's damn hard for the IDE to say at that point if, and what, members a has. For other languages the parsing would be straightforward but for C++, quite a bit of evaluation is needed beforehand.\nIt gets worse. What if my_int_type were defined inside a class template as well? Now its type would depend on another type argument. And here, even compilers fail.\n\nAfter a bit of thinking, a programmer would conclude that this code is the same as the above: Y<int>::my_type resolves to int, therefore b should be the same type as a, right?\nWrong. At the point where the compiler tries to resolve this statement, it doesn't actually know Y<int>::my_type yet! Therefore, it doesn't know that this is a type. It could be something else, e.g. a member function or a field. This might give rise to ambiguities (though not in the present case), therefore the compiler fails. We have to tell it explicitly that we refer to a type name:\n\nNow, the code compiles. To see how ambiguities arise from this situation, consider the following code:\n\nThis code statement is perfectly valid and tells C++ to execute the function call to Y<int>::my_type. However, if my_type is not a function but rather a type, this statement would still be valid and perform a special cast (the function-style cast) which is often a constructor invocation. The compiler can't tell which we mean so we have to disambiguate here.\n", 'questionId': '31693', 'answerId': '31821'}

{'answer': u"Both Java and C# introduced generics after their first language release.  However, there are differences in how the core libraries changed when generics was introduced.  C#'s generics are not just compiler magic and so it was not possible to generify existing library classes without breaking backwards compatibility.\nFor example, in Java the existing Collections Framework was completely genericised.  Java does not have both a generic and legacy non-generic version of the collections classes.  In some ways this is much cleaner - if you need to use a collection in C# there is really very little reason to go with the non-generic version, but those legacy classes remain in place, cluttering up the landscape. \nAnother notable difference is the Enum classes in Java and C#.  Java's Enum has this somewhat tortuous looking definition:\n\n(see Angelika Langer's very clear explanation of exactly why this is so.  Essentially, this means Java can give type safe access from a string to its Enum value:\n\nCompare this to C#'s version:\n\nAs Enum already existed in C# before generics was introduced to the language, the definition could not change without breaking existing code.

{'answer': u'I\'ll add my voice to the noise and take a stab at making things clear:\nC# Generics allow you to declare something like this.\n\nand then the compiler will prevent you from putting things that aren\'t Person into the list.\nBehind the scenes the C# compiler is just putting List<Person> into the .NET dll file, but at runtime the JIT compiler  goes and builds a new set of code, as if you had written a special list class just for containing people - something like ListOfPerson.\nThe benefit of this is that it makes it really fast. There\'s no casting or any other stuff, and because the dll contains the information that this is a List of Person, other code that looks at it later on using reflection can tell that it contains Person objects (so you get intellisense and so on).\nThe downside of this is that old C# 1.0 and 1.1 code (before they added generics) doesn\'t understand these new List<something>, so you have to manually convert things back to plain old List to interoperate with them. This is not that big of a problem, because C# 2.0 binary code is not backwards compatible. The only time this will ever happen is if you\'re upgrading some old C# 1.0/1.1 code to C# 2.0\nJava Generics allow you to declare something like this.\n\nOn the surface it looks the same, and it sort-of is. The compiler will also prevent you from putting things that aren\'t Person into the list.\nThe difference is what happens behind the scenes. Unlike C#, Java does not go and build a special ListOfPerson - it just uses the plain old ArrayList which has always been in Java. When you get things out of the array, the usual Person p = (Person)foo.get(1); casting-dance still has to be done. The compiler is saving you the key-presses, but the speed hit/casting is still incurred just like it always was.\nWhen people mention "Type Erasure" this is what they\'re talking about. The compiler inserts the casts for you, and then \'erases\' the fact that it\'s meant to be a list of Person not just Object\nThe benefit of this approach is that old code which doesn\'t understand generics doesn\'t have to care. It\'s still dealing with the same old ArrayList as it always has. This is more important in the java world because they wanted to support compiling code using Java 5 with generics, and having it run on old 1.4 or previous JVM\'s, which microsoft deliberately decided not to bother with.\nThe downside is the speed hit I mentioned previously, and also because there is no ListOfPerson pseudo-class or anything like that going into the .class files, code that looks at it later on (with reflection, or if you pull it out of another collection where it\'s been converted into Object or so on) can\'t tell in any way that it\'s meant to be a list containing only Person and not just any other array list.\nC++ Templates allow you to declare something like this\n\nIt looks like C# and Java generics, and it will do what you think it should do, but behind the scenes different things are happening.\nIt has the most in common with C# generics in that it builds special pseudo-classes rather than just throwing the type information away like java does, but it\'s a whole different kettle of fish.\nBoth C# and Java produce output which is designed for virtual machines. If you write some code which has a Person class in it, in both cases some information about a Person class will go into the .dll or .class file, and the JVM/CLR will do stuff with this.\nC++ produces raw x86 binary code. Everything is not an object, and there\'s no underlying virtual machine which needs to know about a Person class. There\'s no boxing or unboxing, and functions don\'t have to belong to classes, or indeed anything. \nBecause of this, the C++ compiler places no restrictions on what you can do with templates - basically any code you could write manually, you can get templates to write for you.\nThe most obvious example is adding things:\nIn C# and Java, the generics system needs to know what methods are available for a class, and it needs to pass this down to the virtual machine. The only way to tell it this is by either hard-coding the actual class in, or using interfaces. For example:\n\nThat code won\'t compile in C# or Java, because it doesn\'t know that the type T actually provides a method called Name(). You have to tell it - in C# like this:\n\nAnd then you have to make sure the things you pass to addNames implement the IHasName interface and so on. The java syntax is different (<T extends IHasName>), but it suffers from the same problems.\nThe \'classic\' case for this problem is trying to write a function which does this\n\nYou can\'t actually write this code because there are no ways to declare an interface with the + method in it. You fail.\nC++ suffers from none of these problems. The compiler doesn\'t care about passing types down to any VM\'s - if both your objects have a .Name() function, it will compile. If they don\'t, it won\'t. Simple.\nSo, there you have it :-)\n', 'questionId': '31693', 'answerId': '31929'}

{'answer': u'To directly answer your question: I don\'t know.\nBut here is another solution to your problem:\nIn my mind, there are two statements that collide with each other here: "debug statements" and "production code". \nWhat is the purpose of debug statements? Help to get rid of bugs while (unit) testing. If a piece of software is properly tested and works according to the requirements, debug statements are nothing else but OBSOLETE.\nI strongly disagree with leaving any debug statements in production code. I bet nobody bothers testing side-effects of debug code in production code. The code probably does what it\'s supposed to do, but does it do more than that? Do all your #defines work correctly and really take ALL of the debug code out? Who analyzes 100000 lines of pre-processed code to see if all the debug stuff is gone?\nUnless we have a different definition of production code, you should consider taking out the debug statements after the code is tested and be done with it.\n', 'questionId': '32041', 'answerId': '32091'}
{'answer': u"Two recommendations.\nFirst:\nfor real logging, use a modern logging package like log4j or java's own built in logging. Don't worry about performance so much, the logging level check is on the order of nanoseconds.

Having to restart and run a debug build can be very inconvenient.\nSecond:\nYou may find assertions are more what you need. An assertion is a statement which evaluates to a boolean result, with an optional message:\n\nWhenever the assertion results in a false, the assertion fails and an AssertionError is thrown containing your message (this is an unchecked exception, intended to exit the application). \nThe neat thing is, these are treated special by the JVM and can toggled at runtime down to the class level, using a VM parameter (no recompile needed).

{'answer': u'A clarification about the obj.getClass() != getClass().\nThis statement is the result of equals() being inheritance unfriendly. The JLS (Java language specification) specifies that if A.equals(B) == true then B.equals(A) must also return true. If you omit that statement inheriting classes that override equals() (and change its behavior) will break this specification.\nConsider the following example of what happens when the statement is omitted:\n\nDoing new A(1).equals(new A(1)) Also, new B(1,1).equals(new B(1,1)) result give out true, as it should.\nThis looks all very good, but look what happens if we try to use both classes:\n\nObviously, this is wrong.\nIf you want to ensure the symmetric condition. a=b if b=a and the Liskov substitution principle call super.equals(other) not only in the case of B instance, but check after for A instance:\n\nWhich will output:\n\nWhere, if a is not a reference of B, then it might be a be a reference of class A (because you extend it), in this case you call super.equals() too.\n', 'questionId': '27581', 'answerId': '32223'}

{'answer': u'I agree with the "throw an Exception" crowd. One reason is that calling System.exit makes your code difficult to use if you want other code to be able to use it. For example, if you find out that your class would be useful from a web app, or some kind of message consuming app, it would be nice to allow those containers the opportunity to deal with the failure somehow. A container may want to retry the operation, decide to log and ignore the problem, send an email to an administrator, etc.\nAn exception to this would be your main() method; this could trap the Exception, and call System.exit() with some value that can be recognized by the calling process or shell script.\n', 'questionId': '32790', 'answerId': '33007'}

{'answer': u"Both the use of assertions and the throwing of exceptions are valid approaches here.

The project as a whole needs to decide on an assertion policy: if the choice is to enable assertions during all development, then I'd say to use assertions to check this kind of invalid parameter - in a production system, a NullPointerException thrown due to a programming error is unlikely to be able to be caught and handled in a meaningful way anyway and so will act just like an assertion.\nPractically though, I know a lot of developers that don't trust that assertions will be enabled when appropriate and so opt for the safety of throwing a NullPointerException.\nOf course if you can't enforce a policy for your code (if you're creating a library, for example, and so are dependent on how other developers run your code), you should opt for the safe approach of throwing NullPointerException for those methods that are part of the library's API.\n", 'questionId': '32280', 'answerId': '33552'}
{'answer': u'IMO, wrapping exceptions (checked or otherwise) has several benefits that are worth the cost:\n1) It encourages you to think about the failure modes for the code you write. Basically, you have to consider the exceptions that the code you call may throw, and in turn you\'ll consider the exceptions you\'ll throw for the code that calls yours.\n2) It gives you the opportunity to add additional debugging information into the exception chain. For instance, if you have a method that throws an exception on a duplicate username, you might wrap that exception with one that includes additional information about the circumstances of the failure (for example, the IP of the request that provided the dupe username) that wasn\'t available to the lower-level code. The cookie trail of exceptions may help you debug a complex problem (it certainly has for me).\n3) It lets you become implementation-independent from the lower level code. If you\'re wrapping exceptions and need to swap out Hibernate for some other ORM, you only have to change your Hibernate-handling code. All the other layers of code will still be successfully using the wrapped exceptions and will interpret them in the same way, even though the underlying circumstances have changed. Note that this applies even if Hibernate changes in some way (ex: they switch exceptions in a new version); it\'s not just for wholesale technology replacement.\n4) It encourages you use different classes of exceptions to represent different situations. For example, you may have a DuplicateUsernameException when the user tries to reuse a username, and a DatabaseFailureException when you can\'t check for dupe usernames due to a broken DB connection. This, in turn, lets you answer your question ("how do I recover?") in flexible and powerful ways. If you get a DuplicateUsernameException, you may decide to suggest a different username to the user.

{'answer': u'There are already a lot of good answers on what the differences are, so let me give a slightly different perspective and add the why.\nAs was already explained, the main difference is type erasure, i.e. the fact that the Java compiler erases the generic types and they don\'t end up in the generated bytecode. However, the question is: why would anyone do that? It doesn\'t make sense! Or does it?\nWell, what\'s the alternative? If you don\'t implement generics in the language, where do you implement them? And the answer is: in the Virtual Machine. Which breaks backwards compatibility.\nType erasure, on the other hand, allows you to mix generic clients with non-generic libraries. In other words: code that was compiled on Java 5 can still be deployed to Java 1.4.\nMicrosoft, however, decided to break backwards compatibility for generics. That\'s why .NET Generics are "better" than Java Generics.\nOf course, Sun aren\'t idiots or cowards. The reason why they "chickened out", was that Java was significantly older and more widespread than .NET when they introduced generics. (They were introduced roughly at the same time in both worlds.) Breaking backwards compatibility would have been a huge pain.\nPut yet another way: in Java, Generics are a part of the Language (which means they apply only to Java, not to other languages), in .NET they are part of the Virtual Machine (which means they apply to all languages, not just C# and Visual Basic.NET).\nCompare this with .NET features like LINQ, lambda expressions, local variable type inference, anonymous types and expression trees: these are all language features. That\'s why there are subtle differences between VB.NET and C#: if those features were part of the VM, they would be the same in all languages. But the CLR hasn\'t changed: it\'s still the same in .NET 3.5 SP1 as it was in .NET 2.0. You can compile a C# program that uses LINQ with the .NET 3.5 compiler and still run it on .NET 2.0, provided that you don\'t use any .NET 3.5 libraries. That would not work with generics and .NET 1.1, but it would work with Java and Java 1.4.\n', 'questionId': '31693', 'answerId': '33729'}

Enumerate the hits in the filter's bitset, and for each hit, you get the value of the field from the field cache, and add it to a SortedSet. When you've got all of the hits, divide the size of the set into the number of ranges you want (five to seven is a good number according the user interface guys), and rather than a single-valued constraint, your facets will be a range query with the lower and upper bounds of each of those subsets.\nI'd recommend using some special-case logic for a small number of values; obviously, if you only have four distinct values, it doesn't make sense to try and make 5 range refinements out of them.

{'answer': u'I think throwing an exception is what you should do when something goes wrong. This way, if your application is not running as a stand-alone app the caller can react to it and has some information about what went wrong. It is also easier for debugging purposes because you as well get a better idea about what went wrong when you see a stack trace.\nOne important thing to note is that when the exception reaches the top level and therefore causes the VM to quit the VM returns a return code of 1, therefore outside applications that use the return code see that something went wrong.\nThe only case where I think System.exit() makes sense is when your app is meant to be called by applications which are not Java and therefore have to use return codes to see if your app worked or not and you want those applications to have a chance to react differently on different things going wrong, i.e. you need different return codes.\n', 'questionId': '32790', 'answerId': '34147'}

{'answer': u"There is a pretty good diagram in the JSF specification that shows the request lifecycle - essential for understanding this stuff.\nThe steps are:\n\nRestore View. The UIComponent tree is rebuilt.\nApply Request Values. Editable components should implement EditableValueHolder. This phase walks the component tree and calls the processDecodes methods. If the component isn't something complex like a UIData, it won't do much except call its own decode method. The decode method doesn't do much except find its renderer and invokes its decode method, passing itself as an argument. It is the renderer's job to get any submitted value and set it via setSubmittedValue.\nProcess Validations. This phase calls processValidators which will call validate. The validate method takes the submitted value, converts it with any converters, validates it with any validators and (assuming the data passes those tests) calls setValue. This will store the value as a local variable. While this local variable is not null, it will be returned and not the value from the value binding for any calls to getValue.\nUpdate Model Values. This phase calls processUpdates. In an input component, this will call updateModel which will get the ValueExpression and invoke it to set the value on the model.\nInvoke Application. Button event listeners and so on will be invoked here (as will navigation if memory serves).\nRender Response. The tree is rendered via the renderers and the state saved.\nIf any of these phases fail (e.g. a value is invalid), the lifecycle skips to Render Response.\nVarious events can be fired after most of these phases, invoking listeners as appropriate (like value change listeners after Process Validations).\n\nThis is a somewhat simplified version of events. Refer to the specification for more details.\nI would question why you are writing your own UIComponent. This is a non-trivial task and a deep understanding of the JSF architecture is required to get it right.

So the compilation is slower. In Java the compilation doesn\'t have a major penalty, but Java uses a technique called "erasure" where the generic type is erased at runtime, so at runtime Java is actually calling ...\n\nSo generic programming in Java is not really useful, it\'s only a little syntactic sugar to help with the new foreach construct.\nEDIT: the opinion above on usefulness was written by a younger self.

{'answer': u"If the Java way is the OO way, then yes, creating a class with public fields breaks the principles around information hiding which say that an object should manage its own internal state.

{'answer': u"This is a commonly discussed topic. The drawback of creating public fields in objects is that you have no control over the values that are set to it.

{'answer': u'Re: aku, izb, John Topley...\nWatch out for mutability issues...\nIt may seem sensible to omit getters/setters. It actually may be ok in some cases. The real problem with the proposed pattern shown here is mutability.\nThe problem is once you pass an object reference out containing non-final, public fields. Anything else with that reference is free to modify those fields. You no longer have any control over the state of that object. (Think what would happen if Strings were mutable.)\nIt gets bad when that object is an important part of the internal state of another, you\'ve just exposed internal implementation. To prevent this, a copy of the object must be returned instead. This works, but can cause massive GC pressure from tons of single-use copies created.\nIf you have public fields, consider making the class read-only. Add the fields as parameters to the constructor, and mark the fields final. Otherwise make sure you\'re not exposing internal state, and if you need to construct new instances for a return value, make sure it won\'t be called excessively.\nSee: "Effective Java" by Joshua Bloch -- Item #13: Favor Immutability.\nPS: Also keep in mind, all JVMs these days will optimize away the getMethod if possible, resulting in just a single field-read instruction. \n', 'questionId': '36701', 'answerId': '36944'}

{'answer': u'I think it depends on how resources are produced and consumed. If 5 work objects are available at once and you have 5 consumer objects, it would make sense to wake up all threads using notifyAll() so each one can process 1 work object.\nIf you have just one work object available, what is the point in waking up all consumer objects to race for that one object? The first one checking for available work will get it and all other threads will check and find they have nothing to do.\nI found a great explanation here. In short: \n\nThe notify() method is generally used\n  for resource pools, where there\n  are an arbitrary number of "consumers"\n  or "workers" that take resources, but\n  when a resource is added to the pool,\n  only one of the waiting consumers or\n  workers can deal with it. The\n  notifyAll() method is actually used in\n  most other cases. Strictly, it is\n  required to notify waiters of a\n  condition that could allow multiple\n  waiters to proceed. But this is often\n  difficult to know. So as a general\n  rule, if you have no particular\n  logic for using notify(), then you\n  should probably use notifyAll(),\n  because it is often difficult to know\n  exactly what threads will be waiting\n  on a particular object and why.\n\n', 'questionId': '37026', 'answerId': '37045'}
{'answer': u"Simply put, it depends on why your threads are waiting to be notified. Do you want to tell one of the waiting threads that something happened, or do you want to tell all of them at the same time?\nIn some cases, all waiting threads can take useful action once the wait finishes. An example would be a set of threads waiting for a certain task to finish; once the task has finished, all waiting threads can continue with their business. In such a case you would use notifyAll() to wake up all waiting threads at the same time.\nAnother case, for example mutually exclusive locking, only one of the waiting threads can do something useful after being notified (in this case acquire the lock). In such a case, you would rather use notify(). Properly implemented, you could use notifyAll() in this situation as well, but you would unnecessarily wake threads that can't do anything anyway.\n", 'questionId': '37026', 'answerId': '37046'}
{'answer': u"Useful differences:\n\nUse notify() if all your waiting threads are interchangeable (the order they wake up doesn't matter), or if you only ever have one waiting thread. A common example is a thread pool used to execute jobs from a queue--when a job is added, one of threads is notified to wake up, execute the next job and go back to sleep.\nUse notifyAll() for other cases where the waiting threads may have different purposes and should be able to run concurrently. An example is a maintenance operation on a shared resource, where multiple threads are waiting for the operation to complete before accessing the resource.\n\n", 'questionId': '37026', 'answerId': '37050'}

The future interface is used to represent objects which are not ready yet, but are being created in a separate thread.

I have little programming with UIs, but I believe using Futures for asynchronous calls would let you have a responsive GUI, rather than one that was waiting for a server reply.\nFor the queries I would suggest using method chaining to build the query object, and each object returned by method chaining should be Iterable. Similar to how Djangos model is. Say you have QuerySet which implements Iterable<Song>. You can then call allSongs() which would return a result iterating over all Songs.

{'answer': u"\nis there a way to choose which processor or core it is launched on?\n\nYou can use the task manager to tell windows what CPU(s) your program should be allowed to run on. Normally this is only useful for troubleshooting legacy programs which have broken implementations of multi-threading. To do this, \n\nRun task manager\nFind your process in the Processes window.\nRight click and choose Set Affinity...\nTick the checkboxes next to the CPU's you want to allow your application to run on. Windows will then only schedule threads from that process onto those particular CPU's\n\nIf I recall correctly, windows will 'remember' these settings for subsequent times your process is run, but please don't quote me on that - run some tests yourself :-)\nYou can also do this programatically in .NET after your program has launched using using the System.Diagnostics.Process.ProcessorAffinity property, but I don't think it will 'remember' the settings, so there will always be a short period in which your app is run on whichever CPU windows sees fit. I don't know how to do this in java sorry.\nNote:\nThis applies at the entire process level. If you set affinity for CPU0 only, and then launch 50 threads, all 50 of those threads will run on CPU0, and CPU1, 2, 3, etc will sit around doing nothing.\nJust to reiterate the point, this is primarily useful for troubleshooting broken legacy software. If your software is not broken, you really shouldn't mess with any of these settings, and let windows decide the best CPU(s) to run your program on, so it can take the rest of the system's performance into account.\n\nAs for the 'shared memory' model, it works the same, but there are more things that can go subtly wrong when your app is running on multiple CPU's as opposed to just timeslices on a single one.\nFor an eye-opening example, read this ridiculousfish article about CPU's and Memory Barriers.\nIt's aimed at OSX development on PowerPC, but general enough that it should apply everywhere.

{'answer': u'Iterable only has the method Iterator get() or somesuch. So no need to build any query or execute any code until you actually start iterating.

{'answer': u'Ultimately you always have a finite max of heap to use no matter what platform you are running on. In Windows 32 bit this is around 2gb (not specifically heap but total amount of memory per process). It just happens that Java chooses to make the default smaller (presumably so that the programmer can\'t create programs that have runaway memory allocation without running into this problem and having to examine exactly what they are doing).\nSo this given there are several approaches you could take to either determine what amount of memory you need or to reduce the amount of memory you are using. One common mistake with garbage collected languages such as Java or C# is to keep around references to objects that you no longer are using, or allocating many objects when you could reuse them instead. As long as objects have a reference to them they will continue to use heap space as the garbage collector will not delete them.\nIn this case you can use a Java memory profiler to determine what methods in your program are allocating large number of objects and then determine if there is a way to make sure they are no longer referenced, or to not allocate them in the first place. One option which I have used in the past is "JMP" http://www.khelekore.org/jmp/.\nIf you determine that you are allocating these objects for a reason and you need to keep around references (depending on what you are doing this might be the case), you will just need to increase the max heap size when you start the program. However, once you do the memory profiling and understand how your objects are getting allocated you should have a better idea about how much memory you need. \nIn general if you can\'t guarantee that your program will run in some finite amount of memory (perhaps depending on input size) you will always run into this problem. Only after exhausting all of this will you need to look into caching objects out to disk etc. At this point you should have a very good reason to say "I need Xgb of memory" for something and you can\'t work around it by improving your algorithms or memory allocation patterns. Generally this will only usually be the case for algorithms operating on large datasets (like a database or some scientific analysis program) and then techniques like caching and memory mapped IO become useful.\n', 'questionId': '37335', 'answerId': '37349'}
{'answer': u"In my experience, you're probably better off using an embedded database.  SQL, while less than perfect, is usually much easier than designing a file format that performs well and is reliable.\nI haven't used JavaDB, but I've had good luck with H2 and SQLite.  SQLite is a C library which means a little more work in terms of deployment.  However, it has the benefit of storing the entire database in a single, cross-platform library.  Basically, it is a pre-packaged, generic file format.  SQLite has been so useful that I've even started using it instead of text files in scripts.\nBe careful using Hibernate if you're working with a small persistence problem.

{'answer': u"The name reflection is used to describe code which is able to inspect other code in the same system (or itself).\nFor example, say you have an object of an unknown type in Java, and you would like to call a 'doSomething' method on it if one exists. Java's static typing system isn't really designed to support this unless the object conforms to a known interface, but using reflection, your code can look at the object and find out if it has a method called 'doSomething' and then call it if you want to.\nSo, to give you a code example of this in Java (imagine the object in question is foo) :\n\nOne very common use case in Java is the usage with annotations. JUnit 4, for example, will use reflection to look through your classes for methods tagged with the @Test annotation, and will then call them when running the unit test.\nThere are some good reflection examples to get you started at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/index.html\nAnd finally, yes, the concepts are pretty much similar in other statically types languages which support reflection (like C#). In dynamically typed languages, the use case described above is less necessary (since the compiler will allow any method to be called on any object, failing at runtime if it does not exist), but the second case of looking for methods which are marked or work in a certain way is still common.\n", 'questionId': '37628', 'answerId': '37632'}
{'answer': u"Reflection is a set of functions which allows you to access the runtime information of your program and modify it behavior (with some limitations).\nIt's useful because it allows you to change the runtime behaivour depending on the meta information of your program, that is, you can check the return type of a function and change the way you handle the situation.\nIn C# for example you can load an assembly (a .dll) in runtime an examine it, navigating through the classes and taking actions according to what you found. It also let you create an instance of a class on runtime, invoke its method, etc.\nWhere can it be useful? Is not useful everytime but for concrete situations. For example you can use it to get the name of the class for loggin purposes, to dinamically create handlers for events according to what's specified on a configuration file and so on...\n", 'questionId': '37628', 'answerId': '37634'}
{'answer': u'Not every language supports reflection but the principles are usually the same in languages that support it.\nReflection is the ability to "reflect" on the structure of your program. Or more concrete. To look at the objects and classes you have and programmatically get back information on the methods, fields, and interfaces they implement. You can also look at things like annotations.\nIt\'s usefull in a lot of situations. Everywhere you want to be able to dynamically plug in classes into your code. Lot\'s of object relational mappers use reflection to be able to instantiate objects from databases without knowing in advance what objects they\'re going to use. Plug-in architectures is another place where reflection is usefull. Being able to dynamically load code and determine if there are types there that implement the right interface to use as a plugin is important in those situations.\n', 'questionId': '37628', 'answerId': '37635'}
{'answer': u'\nReflection is a language\'s ability to inspect and dynamically call classes, methods, attributes, etc. at runtime.\n\nFor example, all objects in Java have the method getClass(), which lets you determine the object\'s class even if you don\'t know it at compile time (e.g. if you declared it as an Object) - this might seem trivial, but such reflection is not possible in less dynamic languages such as C++. More advanced uses lets you list and call methods, constructors, etc.\nReflection is important since it lets you write programs that do not have to "know" everything at compile time, making them more dynamic, since they can be tied together at runtime. The code can be written against known interfaces, but the actual classes to be used can be instantiated using reflection from configuration files.\nLots of modern frameworks use reflection extensively for this very reason. Most other modern languages use reflection as well, and in scripting languages (such as Python) they are even more tightly integrated, since it feels more natural within the general programming model of those languages.\n', 'questionId': '37628', 'answerId': '37638'}

It doesn't send the headers to the server until you've gotten one of the streams.  If you just get the input stream then I believe it does a GET, sends the headers, then lets you read the output.  If you get the output stream then I believe it sends it as a POST, as it assumes you'll be writing data to it (You may need to call setDoOutput(true) for the output stream to work).  As soon as you get the input stream the output stream is closed and it waits for the response from the server.\nFor example, this should do a POST:\n\nWhile this would do a GET:\n\nURLConnection will also do other weird things.  If the server specifies a content length then URLConnection will keep the underlying input stream open until it receives that much data, even if you explicitly close it.  This caused a lot of problems for us as it made shutting our client down cleanly a bit hard, as the URLConnection would keep the network connection open.  This probably probably exists even if you just use getStream() though.\n", 'questionId': '39391', 'answerId': '39449'}

{'answer': u'\nThe question is not really related to checked vs. unchecked debate, the same applies to both exception types.\nBetween the point where the ConstraintViolationException is thrown and the point, where we want to handle the violation by displaying a nice error message is a large number of method calls on the stack that should abort immediately and shouldn\'t care about the problem. That makes the exception mechanism the right choice as opposed to redesigning the code from exceptions to return values.\nIn fact, using an unchecked exception instead of a checked exception is a natural fit, since we really want all intermediate methods on the call stack to ignore the exception and not handle it .\nIf we want to handle the "unique name violation" only by displaying a nice error message (error page) to the user, there\'s not really a need for a specific DuplicateUsernameException. This will keep the number of exception classes low. Instead, we can create a MessageException that can be reused in many similar scenarios.\nAs soon as possible we catch the ConstraintViolationException and convert it to a MessageException with a nice message. It\'s important to convert it soon, when we can be sure, it\'s really the "unique user name constraint" that was violated and not some other constraint.\nSomewhere close to the top level handler, just handle the MessageException in a different way. Instead of "we logged your problem but for now you\'re hosed" simply display the message contained in the MessageException, no stack trace.\nThe MessageException can take some additional constructor parameters, such as a detailed explanation of the problem, available next action (cancel, go to a different page), icon (error, warning)...\n\nThe code may look like this\n\nIn a totally different place there\'s a top exception handler\n\n', 'questionId': '33497', 'answerId': '39769'}

{'answer': u'UPDATE: Tapestry 5.2 is out, so it\'s not abandoned, as it previously appeared to be. My experience is with Tapestry 4, not 5, so your mileage may vary. My opinion of Tapestry has changed over the years; I have modified this post to reflect it.\nI can no longer recommend Tapestry as I did previously. Tapestry 5 appears to be a significant improvement, but my main issue with Tapestry is not with platform itself; it\'s with the people behind it.\nHistorically, every major version update of Tapestry has broken backwards compatibility with extreme prejudice, far more than one might expect. This seems to be due to the incorporation of new coding techniques or technologies that require significant rewrites.\nHoward Lewis Ship (the principal author of Tapestry) is certainly a brilliant developer, but I can\'t say I care for his management of the Tapestry project. Development of Tapestry 5 began almost immediately after Tapestry 4 shipped. From what I can tell, Ship pretty much devoted himself to that, leaving Tapestry 4 in the hands of other contributors, who I feel are not nearly as capable as Ship. After having made the painful switch from Tapestry 3 to Tapestry 4, I felt that I had been abandoned almost immediately.\nOf course, with the release of Tapestry 5, Tapestry 4 became a legacy product. I wouldn\'t have a problem with this if the upgrade path wasn\'t so brutal again. So now our development team is in the rather unenviable position: We could continue to use an essentially abandoned web platform (Tapestry 4), make the heinous upgrade to Tapestry 5, or give up on Tapestry entirely and rewrite our application using another platform. None of these options is very attractive.\nTapestry 5 is supposedly written so as to reduce the likelihood of update breakage from this point forward. A good example is in the page classes: in previous incarnations, page classes descended from a base class provided by Tapestry; incompatible API changes in this class were the cause of a large number of backward compatibility problems. In Tapestry 5, pages are POJOs which are enhanced at runtime with the "magic Tapestry fairy dust" via annotations. So as long as the contract for the annotations is maintained, changes to Tapestry won\'t affect your page classes.\nIf this is right, then writing a new application using Tapestry 5 could turn out well. But personally, I don\'t feel like putting my hand on the burner again.\n', 'questionId': '24596', 'answerId': '40194'}

{'answer': u'A tool is a big help.\nHowever, there are times when you can\'t use a tool: the heap dump is so huge it crashes the tool, you are trying to troubleshoot a machine in some production environment to which you only have shell access, etc.\nIn that case, it helps to know your way around the hprof dump file.\nLook for SITES BEGIN. This shows you what objects are using the most memory. But the objects aren\'t lumped together solely by type: each entry also includes a "trace" ID. You can then search for that "TRACE nnnn" to see the top few frames of the stack where the object was allocated. Often, once I see where the object is allocated, I find a bug and I\'m done. Also, note that you can control how many frames are recorded in the stack with the options to -Xrunhprof.\nIf you check out the allocation site, and don\'t see anything wrong, you have to start backward chaining from some of those live objects to root objects, to find the unexpected reference chain. This is where a tool really helps, but you can do the same thing by hand (well, with grep). There is not just one root object (i.e., object not subject to garbage collection). Threads, classes, and stack frames act as root objects, and anything they reference strongly is not collectible.\nTo do the chaining, look in the HEAP DUMP section for entries with the bad trace id. This will take you to an OBJ or ARR entry, which shows a unique object identifier in hexadecimal. Search for all occurrences of that id to find who\'s got a strong reference to the object. Follow each of those paths backward as they branch until you figure out where the leak is. See why a tool is so handy?\nStatic members are a repeat offender for memory leaks. In fact, even without a tool, it\'d be worth spending a few minutes looking through your code for static Map members. Can a map grow large?

{'answer': u'Java is always pass by value, with no exceptions, ever.\nSo how is it that anyone can be at all confused by this, and believe that Java is pass by reference, or think they have an example of Java acting as pass by reference? The key point is that Java never provides direct access to the values of objects themselves, in any circumstances. The only access to objects is through a reference to that object. Because Java objects are always accessed through a reference, rather than directly, it is common to talk about fields and variables and method arguments as being objects, when pedantically they are only references to objects. The confusion stems from this (strictly speaking, incorrect) change in nomenclature.\nSo, when calling a method\n\nFor primitive arguments (int, long, etc.), the pass by value is the actual value of the primitive (for example, 3).\nFor objects, the pass by value is the value of the reference to the object.\n\nSo if you have doSomething(foo) and public void doSomething(Foo foo) { .. } the two Foos have copied references that point to the same objects.\nNaturally, passing by value a reference to an object looks very much like (and is indistinguishable in practice from) passing an object by reference.\n', 'questionId': '40480', 'answerId': '40499'}

{'answer': u'Java is always pass-by-value. Unfortunately, they decided to call the location of an object a "reference".  When we pass the value of an object, we are passing the reference to it.  This is confusing to beginners.\nIt goes like this:\n\nIn this example aDog.getName() will still return "Max". The value aDog within main is not changed in the function foo with the Dog "Fifi" as the object reference is passed by value. If it were passed by reference, then the aDog.getName() in main would return "Fifi" after the call to foo.\nLikewise:\n\nIn the above example, FiFi is the dog\'s name after call to foo(aDog) because the object\'s name was set inside of foo(...).

{'answer': u"To make a long story short, Java objects have some very peculiar properties.\nIn general, Java has primitive types (int, bool, char, double, etc) that are passed directly by value. Then Java has objects (everything that derives from java.lang.Object). Objects are actually always handled through a reference (a reference being a pointer that you can't touch). That means that in effect, objects are passed by reference, as the references are normally not interesting. It does however mean that you cannot change which object is pointed to as the reference itself is passed by value.\nDoes this sound strange and confusing? Let's consider how C implements pass by reference and pass by value. In C, the default convention is pass by value. void foo(int x) passes an int by value. void foo(int *x) is a function that does not want an int a, but a pointer to an int: foo(&a). One would use this with the & operator to pass a variable address.\nTake this to C++, and we have references. References are basically (in this context) syntactic sugar that hide the pointer part of the equation: void foo(int &x) is called by foo(a), where the compiler itself knows that it is a reference and the address of the non-reference a should be passed. In Java, all variables referring to objects are actually of reference type, in effect forcing call by reference for most intends and purposes without the fine grained control (and complexity) afforded by, for example, C++.\n", 'questionId': '40480', 'answerId': '40630'}

{'answer': u'Algorithm\nTo generate a random string, concatenate characters drawn randomly from the set of acceptable symbols until the string reaches the desired length.\nImplementation\nHere\'s some fairly simple and very flexible code for generating random identifiers. Read the information that follows for important application notes.\n\nUsage examples\nCreate an insecure generator for 8-character identifiers:\n\nCreate a secure generator for session identifiers:\n\nCreate a generator with easy-to-read codes for printing. The strings are longer than full alphanumeric strings to compensate for using fewer symbols:\n\nUse as session identifiers\nGenerating session identifiers that are likely to be unique is not good enough, or you could just use a simple counter. Attackers hijack sessions when predictable identifiers are used.\nThere is tension between length and security. Shorter identifiers are easier to guess, because there are fewer possibilities. But longer identifiers consume more storage and bandwidth. A larger set of symbols helps, but might cause encoding problems if identifiers are included in URLs or re-entered by hand.\nThe underlying source of randomness, or entropy, for session identifiers should come from a random number generator designed for cryptography. However, initializing these generators can sometimes be computationally expensive or slow, so effort should be made to re-use them when possible.\nUse as object identifiers\nNot every application requires security. Random assignment can be an efficient way for multiple entities to generate identifiers in a shared space without any coordination or partitioning. Coordination can be slow, especially in a clustered or distributed environment, and splitting up a space causes problems when entities end up with shares that are too small or too big.\nIdentifiers generated without taking measures to make them unpredictable should be protected by other means if an attacker might be able to view and manipulate them, as happens in most web applications. There should be a separate authorization system that protects objects whose identifier can be guessed by an attacker without access permission.\nCare must be also be taken to use identifiers that are long enough to make collisions unlikely given the anticipated total number of identifiers. This is referred to as "the birthday paradox." The probability of a collision, p, is approximately n2/(2qx), where n is the number of identifiers actually generated, q is the number of distinct symbols in the alphabet, and x is the length of the identifiers. This should be a very small number, like 2\u201150 or less.\nWorking this out shows that the chance of collision among 500k 15-character identifiers is about 2\u201152, which is probably less likely than undetected errors from cosmic rays, etc.\nComparison with UUIDs\nAccording to their specification, UUIDs are not designed to be unpredictable, and should not be used as session identifiers.\nUUIDs in their standard format take a lot of space: 36 characters for only 122 bits of entropy. (Not all bits of a "random" UUID are selected randomly.) A randomly chosen alphanumeric string packs more entropy in just 21 characters.\nUUIDs are not flexible; they have a standardized structure and layout. This is their chief virtue as well as their main weakness. When collaborating with an outside party, the standardization offered by UUIDs may be helpful. For purely internal use, they can be inefficient.\n', 'questionId': '41107', 'answerId': '41156'}

{'answer': u"Short answer: draw your system architecture in terms of modules, drawn side-by-side, with each module sliced vertically into layers (e.g. view, model, persistence). Then use a structure like com.mycompany.myapp.somemodule.somelayer, e.g. com.mycompany.myapp.client.view or com.mycompany.myapp.server.model.\nUsing the top level of packages for application modules, in the old-fashioned computer-science sense of modular programming, ought to be obvious. However, on most of the projects I have worked on we end up forgetting to do that, and end up with a mess of packages without that top-level structure. This anti-pattern usually shows itself as a package for something like 'listeners' or 'actions' that groups otherwise unrelated classes simply because they happen to implement the same interface.\nWithin a module, or in a small application, use packages for the application layers. Likely packages include things like the following, depending on the architecture:\n\ncom.mycompany.myapp.view\ncom.mycompany.myapp.model\ncom.mycompany.myapp.services\ncom.mycompany.myapp.rules\ncom.mycompany.myapp.persistence (or 'dao' for data access layer)\ncom.mycompany.myapp.util (beware of this being used as if it were 'misc')\n\nWithin each of these layers, it is natural to group classes by type if there are a lot. A common anti-pattern here is to unnecessarily introduce too many packages and levels of sub-package so that there are only a few classes in each package.\n", 'questionId': '7596', 'answerId': '43779'}

{'answer': u'Short story: \xad\xad\xad\xad\xad\xad\xad\xad\xad\xad\xad\xad\xad\xad\xad\xad\xad\xad\xadno.         \n\nIntroduction\nThe newest version of the Microsoft Visual J++ development environment\n  supports a language construct called delegates or bound method\n  references. This construct, and the new keywords delegate and\n  multicast introduced to support it, are not a part of the JavaTM\n  programming language, which is specified by the Java Language\n  Specification and amended by the Inner Classes Specification included\n  in the documentation for the JDKTM 1.1 software. \nIt is unlikely that the Java programming language will ever include\n  this construct. Sun already carefully considered adopting it in 1996,\n  to the extent of building and discarding working prototypes. Our\n  conclusion was that bound method references are unnecessary and\n  detrimental to the language. This decision was made in consultation\n  with Borland International, who had previous experience with bound\n  method references in Delphi Object Pascal. \nWe believe bound method references are unnecessary because another\n  design alternative, inner classes, provides equal or superior\n  functionality. In particular, inner classes fully support the\n  requirements of user-interface event handling, and have been used to\n  implement a user-interface API at least as comprehensive as the\n  Windows Foundation Classes. \nWe believe bound method references are harmful because they detract\n  from the simplicity of the Java programming language and the\n  pervasively object-oriented character of the APIs. Bound method\n  references also introduce irregularity into the language syntax and\n  scoping rules. Finally, they dilute the investment in VM technologies\n  because VMs are required to handle additional and disparate types of\n  references and method linkage efficiently.\n\n', 'questionId': '44912', 'answerId': '44916'}
{'answer': u"Not really, no.\nYou may be able to achieve the same effect by using reflection to get Method objects you can then invoke, and the other way is to create an interface with a single 'invoke' or 'execute' method, and then instantiate them to call the method your interested in (i.e. using an anonymous inner class).\nYou might also find this article interesting / useful : A Java Programmer Looks at C# Delegates\n", 'questionId': '44912', 'answerId': '44928'}

There is a little bit of documentation on how to do that in the Spring Reference Manual.  Also see the AbstractEnterpriseBean Javadoc for some additional information about how the Spring context is retrieved.  \nThe extra configuration required for a WebServiceMessageDrivenBean appear to be a ConnectionFactory, a WebServiceMessageFactory, and your WebServiceMessageReceiver.

{'answer': u'It\'s worth knowing that the date format you have given is not an arbitrary one. It is the output of the built-in Date.toString() method (at least in the UK and US locales). Not coincidentally, it is also the format of the unix \'date\' command (at least on linux, and I believe in other implementations too) - though to be pedantic, Date.toString() pads one-digit day numbers with a zero while unix date does not.\nWhat this means is that you are likely to receive this input format when you output an unformatted date into a user-modifiable field (e.g. an HTML INPUT field) and receive it back unmodified. So just because input is coming in this format, doesn\'t mean the users will type in a thousand other arbitrary formats.\nOf course, they still might. The way I handle date inputs in general is with a bunch of try/catch blocks, where I try it against one format, then another, then another. Our standard framework is now up to about 20 different formats by default.

{'answer': u'Automatic serialVersionUID is calculated based on members of a class. These can be shown for a class file using the javap tool in the Sun JDK.\nIn the case mentioned in the question, the member that is added/removed is the static initialiser. This appears as ()V in class files. The contents of the method can be disassembled using javap -c. You should be able to make out the System.getProperty("foo") call and assignment to MYSTRING. However an assignment with a string literal (or any compile-time constant as defined by the Java Language Specification) is supported directly by the class file, so removing the need for a static initialiser.\nA common case for code targeting J2SE 1.4 (use -source 1.4 -target 1.4) or earlier is static fields to old Class instances which appear as class literals in source code (MyClass.class). The Class instance is looked up on demand with Class.forName, and the stored in a static field. It is this static field that disrupts the serialVersionUID. From J2SE 5.0, a variant of the ldc opcode gives direct support for class literals, removing the need for the synthetic field.

{'answer': u'Assuming "alphanumeric" means letters and numbers, you could treat each letter/number as a base-36 digit. Unfortunately, large strings will cause the number to grow rapidly and you\'d have to resort to big integers, which are hardly efficient.\nIf your strings are usually different when you make the comparison (i.e. searching for a specific string) the hash might be your best option. Once you get a potential hit, you can do the string comparison to be sure. A well-designed hash will make collisions exceedingly rare.\n', 'questionId': '46160', 'answerId': '46199'}

{'answer': u"Why don't you do something like 1stChar + (10 x 2ndChar) + 100 x (3rdChar) ...., where you use the simple integer value of each character, i.e. a = 1, b = 2 etc, or just the integer value if it's not a letter. This will give a unique value for each string, even for 2 strings that are just the same letters in a different order.\nOf course if gets more complicated if you need to worry about Unicode rather than just ASCII and the numbers could get large if you need to use long string.\nAre the standard Java string comparison functions definitely not efficient enough?\n", 'questionId': '46160', 'answerId': '46209'}
{'answer': u"How long are the strings? If they are very short, then a unique ID can be generated by considering the characters as digits in base 36 (26 + 10) that form a n-digits number where n is the length of the string. On the other hand, if the strings are short enough to allow this, direct comparison won't be an issue anyway.\nOtherwise you'll have to generate a collision-free hash and this can only be done when the complete problem space is known in advance (i.e. if you know all strings that can possibly occur). You will want to have a look at perfect hashing, although the only feasible algorithm to find a perfect hash function that I know is probabilistic so collisions are still theoretically possible.\nThere might be other ways to find such a function. Knuth called this a \u201crather amusing \u2026\xa0puzzle\u201d in TAoCP but he doesn't give an algorithm either.\nIn general, you give way too few information to find an algorithm that doesn't require probing the whole problem space in some manner.

{'answer': u"Unless your string is limited in length, you can't avoid collisions. \nThere are 4294967296 possible values for an integer (2^32). If you have a string of more than 4 ASCII characters, or more than two unicode characters, then there are more possible string values than possible integer values. You can't have a unique integer value for every possible 5 character string. Long values have more possible values, but they would only provide a unique value for every possible string of 8 ASCII characters.\nHash codes are useful as a two step process: first see if the hash code matches, then check the whole string. For most strings that don't match, you only need to do the first step, and it's really fast.\n", 'questionId': '46160', 'answerId': '46216'}
{'answer': u"\nString length may vary, but let's say 10 characters for now.\n\nIn that case, in order to guarantee uniqueness you'd have to use some sort of big integer representation.  I doubt that doing comparisons on big integers would be substantially faster than doing string comparisons in the first place.  I'll second what other's have said here, use some sort of hash, then in the event of a hash match check the original strings to weed out any collisions.\nIn any case, If your strings are around 10 characters, I doubt that comparing, say, a bunch of 32 bit hashes will be all that much faster than direct string comparisons.  I think you have to ask yourself if it's it really worth the additional complexity.\n", 'questionId': '46160', 'answerId': '46224'}
{'answer': u"At the end of the day, a single alphanumeric character has at least 36 possible values.  If you include punctuation, lower case, etc then you can easily pass 72 possible values.\nA non-colliding number that allows you to quickly compare strings would necessarily grow exponentially with the length of the string.\nSo you first must decide on the longest string you are expecting to compare.  Assuming it's N characters in length, and assuming you ONLY need uppercase letters and the numerals 0-9 then you need to have an integer representation that can be as high as\n36^N\nFor a string of length 25 (common name field) then you end up needing a binary number with  130 bits.\nIf you compose that into 32 bit numbers, you'll need 4.  Then you can compare each number (four integer compares should take no time, compared to walking the string).  I would recommend a big number library, but for this specialized case I'm pretty sure you can write your own and get better performance.\nIf you want to handle 72 possible values per character (uppercase, lowercase, numerals, punctuation...) and you need 10 characters, then you'll need 62 bits - two 32 bit integers (or one 64 bit if you're on a system that supports 64 bit computing)\nIf, however, you are not able to restrict the numbers in the string (ie, could be any of the 256 letters/numbers/characters/etc) and you can't define the size of the string, then comparing the strings directly is the only way to go, but there's a shortcut.\nCast the pointer of the string to a 32 bit unsigned integer array, and compare the string 4 bytes at a time (or 64 bits/8bytes at a time on a 64 bit processor).  This means that a 100 character string only requires 25 compares maximum to find which is greater.\nYou may need to re-define the character set (and convert the strings) so that the characters with higher precedence are assigned values closer to 0, and lower precedence values closer to 255 (or vice versa, depending on how you are comparing them).\nGood luck!\n-Adam\n", 'questionId': '46160', 'answerId': '46247'}
{'answer': u"If you're trying to test existing code that you're reluctant or unable to change, reflection is a good choice.\nIf the class's design is still flexible, and you've got a complicated private method that you'd like to test separately, I suggest you pull it out into a separate class and test that class separately. This doesn't have to change the public interface of the original class; it can internally create an instance of the helper class and call the helper method.\nIf you want to test difficult error conditions coming from the helper method, you can go a step further. Extract an interface from the helper class, add a public getter and setter to the original class to inject the helper class (used through its interface), and then inject a mock version of the helper class into the original class to test how the original class responds to exceptions from the helper.

However, the SortedMap interface extends Map and provides exactly what you are looking for - implementations will aways give a consistent sort order.\nNavigableMap is another useful extension - this is a SortedMap with additional methods for finding entries by their ordered position in the key set.  So potentially this can remove the need for iterating in the first place - you might be able to find the specific entry you are after using the higherEntry, lowerEntry, ceilingEntry, or floorEntry methods.  The descendingMap method even gives you an explicit method of reversing the traversal order.\n", 'questionId': '46898', 'answerId': '46989'}

{'answer': u"The + operator can work between a string and a string, char, integer, double or float data type value.

{'answer': u"I don't think so. a.concat(b) is implemented in String and I think the implementation didn't change much since early java machines. The + operation implementation depends on java version and compiler. Currently + is implemented using StringBuffer to make the operation as fast as possible. Maybe in future this will change. In earlier versions of java + operation on Strings was much slower as it produced intermediate results. I guess that += is implemented using + and similarly optimized.\n", 'questionId': '47605', 'answerId': '47624'}
{'answer': u"Niyaz is correct, but it's also worth noting that the special + operator can be converted into something more efficient by the Java compiler.  Java has a StringBuilder class which represents a non-thread-safe, mutable String.  When performing a bunch of String concatenations, the Java compiler silently converts\n\ninto\n\nwhich for large strings is significantly more efficient.  As far as I know, this does not happen when you use the concat method.\nHowever, the concat method is more efficient when concatenating an empty String onto an existing String.  In this case, the JVM does not need to create a new String object and can simply return the existing one.  See the concat documentation to confirm this.\nSo if you're super-concerned about efficiency then you should use the concat method when concatenating possibly-empty Strings, and use + otherwise.  However, the performance difference should be negligible and you probably shouldn't ever worry about this.\n", 'questionId': '47605', 'answerId': '47626'}
{'answer': u"No, not quite.\nFirstly, there's a slight difference in semantics. If a is null, then a.concat(b) throws a NullPointerException but a+=b will treat the original value of a as if it were null. Furthermore, the concat() method only accepts String values while the + operator will silently convert the argument to a String (using the toString() method for objects). So the concat() method is more strict in what it accepts.\nTo look under the hood, write a simple class with a += b;\n\nNow disassemble with javap -c (included in the Sun JDK). You should see a listing including:\n\nSo, a += b is the equivalent of\n\nThe concat method should be faster. However, with more strings the StringBuilder method wins, at least in terms of performance.\nThe source code of String and StringBuilder (and its package-private base class) is available in src.zip of the Sun JDK. You can see that you are building up a char array (resizing as necessary) and then throwing it away when you create the final String. In practice memory allocation is surprisingly fast.\n", 'questionId': '47605', 'answerId': '47628'}

The concat() version execution took half of the time on average.\nThis result surprised me because the concat() method always creates a new string (it returns a "new String(result)". It\'s well known that:\n\nWhy wasn\'t the compiler capable of optimize the string creation in "a + b" code, knowing the it always resulted in the same string? It could avoid a new string creation.\nIf you don\'t believe the statement above, test for your self. \n', 'questionId': '47605', 'answerId': '47694'}
{'answer': u'You should be using IllegalArgumentException (IAE), not NullPointerException (NPE) for the following reasons:\nFirst, the NPE JavaDoc explicitly lists the cases where NPE is appropriate.  Notice that all of them are thrown by the runtime when null is used inappropriately.  In contrast, the IAE JavaDoc couldn\'t be more clear: "Thrown to indicate that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument."  Yup, that\'s you!\nSecond, when you see an NPE in a stack trace, what do you assume?  Probably that someone dereferenced a null.  When you see IAE, you assume the caller of the method at the top of the stack passed in an illegal value.  Again, the latter assumption is true, the former is misleading.\nThird, since IAE is clearly designed for validating parameters, you have to assume it as the default choice of exception, so why would you choose NPE instead?  Certainly not for different behavior -- do you really expect calling code to catch NPE\'s separately from IAE and do something different as a result?  Are you trying to communicate a more specific error message?  But you can do that in the exception message text anyway, as you should for all other incorrect parameters.\nFourth, all other incorrect parameter data will be IAE, so why not be consistent?  Why is it that an illegal null is so special that it deserves a separate exception from all other types of illegal arguments?\nFinally, I accept the argument given by other answers that parts of the Java API use NPE in this manner.  However, the Java API is inconsistent with everything from exception types to naming conventions, so I think just blindly copying (your favorite part of) the Java API isn\'t a good enough argument to trump these other considerations.\n', 'questionId': '3881', 'answerId': '47710'}
{'answer': u"Tom is correct in describing exactly what the + operator does.  It creates a temporary StringBuilder, appends the parts, and finishes with toString().\nHowever, all of the answers so far are ignoring the effects of HotSpot runtime optimizations.  Specifically, these temporary operations are recognized as a common pattern and are replaced with more efficient machine code at run-time.\n@marcio: You've created a micro-benchmark; with modern JVM's this is not a valid way to profile code.\nThe reason run-time optimization matters is that many of these differences in code -- even including object-creation -- are completely different once HotSpot gets going.  The only way to know for sure is profiling your code in situ.\nFinally, all of these methods are in fact incredibly fast.  This might be a case of premature optimization.  If you have code that concatenates strings a lot, the way to get maximum speed probably has nothing to do with which operators you choose and instead the algorithm you're using!\n", 'questionId': '47605', 'answerId': '47716'}

{'answer': u'Adding control structures and returns to finally{} blocks are just another example of "just because you can" abuses which are scattered throughout virtually all development languages.

Even if you had a method whereby you checked an external state, did a time consuming operation, then checked that state again in case it became invalid, you would still want the second check inside the try{} - if it sat inside finally{} and the long operation failed, you would then be checking that state a second time needlessly.\n', 'questionId': '48088', 'answerId': '48106'}

{'answer': u'Hank Shiffman from SGI said (a long time ago, but it\'s till true):\n\nThere are three advantages of Java\n  using byte code instead of going to\n  the native code of the system:\n\nPortability: Each kind of computer has its unique instruction\n  set. While some processors include the\n  instructions for their predecessors,\n  it\'s generally true that a program\n  that runs on one kind of computer\n  won\'t run on any other. Add in the\n  services provided by the operating\n  system, which each system describes in\n  its own unique way, and you have a\n  compatibility problem. In general, you\n  can\'t write and compile a program for\n  one kind of system and run it on any\n  other without a lot of work. Java gets\n  around this limitation by inserting\n  its virtual machine between the\n  application and the real environment\n  (computer + operating system). If an\n  application is compiled to Java byte\n  code and that byte code is interpreted\n  the same way in every environment then\n  you can write a single program which\n  will work on all the different\n  platforms where Java is supported.\n  (That\'s the theory, anyway. In\n  practice there are always small\n  incompatibilities lying in wait for\n  the programmer.)\nSecurity: One of Java\'s virtues is its integration into the Web. Load\n  a web page that uses Java into your\n  browser and the Java code is\n  automatically downloaded and executed.\n  But what if the code destroys files,\n  whether through malice or sloppiness\n  on the programmer\'s part? Java\n  prevents downloaded applets from doing\n  anything destructive by disallowing\n  potentially dangerous operations.\n  Before it allows the code to run it\n  examines it for attempts to bypass\n  security. It verifies that data is\n  used consistently: code that\n  manipulates a data item as an integer\n  at one stage and then tries to use it\n  as a pointer later will be caught and\n  prevented from executing. (The Java\n  language doesn\'t allow pointer\n  arithmetic, so you can\'t write Java\n  code to do what we just described.\n  However, there is nothing to prevent\n  someone from writing destructive byte\n  code themselves using a hexadecimal\n  editor or even building a Java byte\n  code assembler.) It generally isn\'t\n  possible to analyze a program\'s\n  machine code before execution and\n  determine whether it does anything\n  bad. Tricks like writing\n  self-modifying code mean that the evil\n  operations may not even exist until\n  later. But Java byte code was designed\n  for this kind of validation: it\n  doesn\'t have the instructions a\n  malicious programmer would use to hide\n  their assault.\nSize: In the microprocessor world RISC is generally preferable\n  over CISC. It\'s better to have a small\n  instruction set and use many fast\n  instructions to do a job than to have\n  many complex operations implemented as\n  single instructions. RISC designs\n  require fewer gates on the chip to\n  implement their instructions, allowing\n  for more room for pipelines and other\n  techniques to make each instruction\n  faster. In an interpreter, however,\n  none of this matters. If you want to\n  implement a single instruction for the\n  switch statement with a variable\n  length depending on the number of case\n  clauses, there\'s no reason not to do\n  so. In fact, a complex instruction set\n  is an advantage for a web-based\n  language: it means that the same\n  program will be smaller (fewer\n  instructions of greater complexity),\n  which means less time to transfer\n  across our speed-limited network.\n\n\nSo when considering byte code vs native, consider which trade-offs you want to make between portability, security, size, and execution speed. If speed is the only important factor, go native. If any of the others are more important, go with bytecode.\nI\'ll also add that maintaining a series of OS and architecture-targeted compilations of the same code base for every release can become very tedious. It\'s a huge win to use the same Java bytecode on multiple platforms and have it "just work."\n', 'questionId': '48144', 'answerId': '48153'}
{'answer': u"Ideally you would have portable bytecode that compiles Just In Time to native code.  I think the reason bytecode interpreters exist without JIT is due primarily to the practical fact that native code compilation adds complexity to a virtual machine.  It takes time to build, debug, and maintain that additional component.  Not everyone has the time or resources to make that commitment.\nA secondary factor is safety.  It's much easier to verify an interpreter won't crash than to guarantee the same for native code.\nThird is performance.  It can often take more time to generate machine code than to interpret bytecode for small pieces of code that only run once.\n", 'questionId': '48144', 'answerId': '48156'}
{'answer': u'The performance of essentially any program will improve if it is compiled, executed with profiling, and the results fed back into the compiler for a second pass. The code paths which are actually used will be more aggressively optimized, loops unrolled to exactly the right degree, and the hot instruction paths arranged to maximize I$ hits.\nAll good stuff, yet it is almost never done because it is annoying to go through so many steps to build a binary.\nThis is the advantage of running the bytecode for a while before compiling it to native code: profiling information is automatically available. The result after Just-In-Time compilation is highly optimized native code for the specific data the program is processing.\nBeing able to run the bytecode also enables more aggressive native optimization than a static compiler could safely use. For example if one of the arguments to a function is noted to always be NULL, all handling for that argument can simply be omitted from the native code. There will be a brief validity check of the arguments in the function prologue, if that argument is not NULL the VM aborts back to the bytecode and starts profiling again.\n', 'questionId': '48144', 'answerId': '48159'}

{'answer': u'Jeff\'s mechanism was to create some sort of cached object which ASP.Net would automatically recreate at some sort of interval - It seemed to be an ASP.Net specific solution, so probably won\'t help you (or me) much in Java world.\nSee https://stackoverflow.fogbugz.com/default.asp?W13117\n\nAtwood: Well, I originally asked on Twitter, because I just wanted something light weight.  I really didn\'t want to like write a windows service.  I felt like that was out of band code. Plus the code that actually does the work is a web page in fact, because to me that is a logical unit of work on a website is a web page.  So, it really is like we are calling back into the web site, it\'s just like another request in the website, so I viewed it as something that should stay inline, and the little approach that we came up that was recommended to me on Twitter was to essentially to add something to the application cache with a fixed expiration, then you have a call back so when that expires it calls a certain function which does the work then you add it back in to the cache with the same expiration.  So, it\'s a little bit, maybe "ghetto" is the right word.\n\nMy approach has always been to have to OS (i.e. Cron or the Windows task scheduler) load a specific URL at some interval, and then setup a page at that URL to check it\'s queue, and perform whatever tasks were required, but I\'d be interested to hear if there\'s a better way.\nFrom the transcript, it looks like FogBugz uses the windows service loading a URL approach also.\n\nSpolsky: So we have this special page called heartbeat.asp.  And that page, whenever you hit it, and anybody can hit it at anytime: doesn\'t hurt.  But when that page runs it checks a queue of waiting tasks to see if there\'s anything that needs to be done.  And if there\'s anything that needs to be done, it does one thing and then looks in that queue again and if there\'s anything else to be done it returns a plus, and the entire web page that it returns is just a single character with a plus in it.  And if there\'s nothing else to be done, the queue is now empty, it returns a minus.  So, anybody can call this and hit it as many times, you can load up heartbeat.asp in your web browser you hit Ctrl-R Ctrl-R Ctrl-R Ctrl-R until you start getting minuses instead of pluses.  And when you\'ve done that FogBugz will have completed all of its maintenance work that it needs to do.  So that\'s the first part, and the second part is a very, very simple Windows service which runs, and its whole job is to call heartbeat.asp and if it gets a plus, call it again soon, and if it gets a minus call it again, but not for a while.  So basically there\'s this Windows service that\'s always running, that has a very, very, very simple task of just hitting a URL, and looking to see if it gets a plus or a minus and, and then scheduling when it runs again based on whether it got a plus or a minus.  And obviously you can do any kind of variation you want on this theme, like for example, uh you could actually, instead of returning just a plus or minus you could say "Okay call me back in 60 seconds" or "Call me back right away I have more work to be done."  And that\'s how it works... so that maintenance service it just runs, you know, it\'s like, you know, a half page of code that runs that maintenance service, and it never has to change, and it doesn\'t have any of the logic in there, it just contains the tickling that causes these web pages to get called with a certain guaranteed frequency.  And inside that web page at heartbeat.asp there\'s code that maintains a queue of tasks that need to be done and looks at how much time has elapsed and does, you know, late-night maintenance and every seven days delete all the older messages that have been marked as spam and all kinds of just maintenance background tasks.  And uh, that\'s how that does that.\n\n', 'questionId': '48293', 'answerId': '48297'}

{'answer': u"I think developing a custom solution for running background tasks doesn't always worth, so I recommend to use the Quartz Scheduler in Java.\nIn your situation (need to run background tasks in a web application) you could use the ServletContextListener included in the distribution to initialize the engine at the startup of your web container.\nAfter that you have a number of possibilities to start (trigger) your background tasks (jobs), e.g. you can use Calendars or cron-like expressions. In your situation most probably you should settle with SimpleTrigger that lets you run jobs in fixed, regular intervals.\nThe jobs themselves can be described easily too in Quartz, however you haven't provided any details about what you need to run, so I can't provide a suggestion in that area.\n", 'questionId': '48293', 'answerId': '48332'}
{'answer': u"As mentioned, Quartz is one standard solution. If you don't care about clustering or persistence of background tasks across restarts, you can use the built in  ThreadPool support (in Java 5,6). If you use a ScheduledExecutorService you can put Runnables into the background thread pool that wait a specific amount of time before executing. \nIf you do care about clustering and/or persistence, you can use JMS queues for asynchronous execution, though you will still need some way of delaying background tasks (you can use Quartz or the ScheduledExecutorService to do this).\n", 'questionId': '48293', 'answerId': '48335'}

You can read more about synchronization in Java Concurrency in Practice.\nThe difference between Hashtable (note that the T is not a capital letter) and HashMap is similiar, the former is synchronized, the latter is not synchronized.\nI would say that there are no rule of thumb for preferring one implementation or another, it really depends on your needs.\n', 'questionId': '48442', 'answerId': '48451'}

{'answer': u"Lists allow duplicate items, while Sets allow only one instance.\nI'll use a Map whenever I'll need to perform a lookup.\nFor the specific implementations, there are order-preserving variations of Maps and Sets but largely it comes down to speed. I'll tend to use ArrayList for reasonably small Lists and HashSet for reasonably small sets, but there are many implementations (including any that you write yourself). HashMap is pretty common for Maps. Anything more than 'reasonably small' and you have to start worrying about memory so that'll be way more specific algorithmically.\nThis page has lots of animated images along with sample code testing LinkedList vs. ArrayList if you're interested in hard numbers.\nEDIT: I hope the following links demonstrate how these things are really just items in a toolbox, you just have to think about what your needs are: See Commons-Collections versions of Map, List and Set.\n", 'questionId': '48442', 'answerId': '48457'}
{'answer': u"I'll assume you know the difference between a List, Set and Map from the above answers. Why you would choose between their implementing classes is another thing. For example:\nList:\n\nArrayList is quick on retrieving, but slow on inserting. It's good for an implementation that reads a lot but doesn't insert/remove a lot. It keeps its data in one continuous block of memory, so every time it needs to expand, it copies the whole array.\nLinkedList is slow on retrieving, but quick on inserting. It's good for an implementation that inserts/removes a lot but doesn't read a lot. It doesn't keep the entire array in one continuous block of memory.\n\nSet:\n\nHashSet doesn't guarantee the order of iteration, and therefore is fastest of the sets. It has high overhead and is slower than ArrayList, so you shouldn't use it except for a large amount of data when its hashing speed becomes a factor.\nTreeSet keeps the data ordered, therefore is slower than HashSet.\n\nMap: The performance and behavior of HashMap and TreeMap are parallel to the Set implementations.\nVector and Hashtable should not be used. They are synchronized implementations, before the release of the new Collection hierarchy, thus slow. If synchronization is needed, use Collections.synchronizedCollection().\n", 'questionId': '48442', 'answerId': '48462'}
{'answer': u"I found Bruce Eckel's Thinking in Java to be very helpful.  He compares the different collections very well.

Performance usually means not thread safe.  \n", 'questionId': '48442', 'answerId': '48471'}
{'answer': u"For non-sorted the best choice, more than nine times out of ten, will be: ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet.\nVector and Hashtable are synchronised and therefore might be a bit slower. It's rare that you would want synchronised implementations, and when you do their interfaces are not sufficiently rich for thier synchronisation to be useful. In the case of Map, ConcurrentMap adds extra operations to make the interface useful. ConcurrentHashMap is a good implementation of ConcurrentMap.\nLinkedList is almost never a good idea. Even if you are doing a lot of insertions and removal, if you are using an index to indicate position then that requires iterating through the list to find the correct node. ArrayList is almost always faster.\nFor Map and Set, the hash variants will be faster than tree/sorted. Hash algortihms tend to have O(1) performance, whereas trees will be O(log n).\n", 'questionId': '48442', 'answerId': '48520'}
{'answer': u'Theoretically there are useful Big-Oh tradeoffs, but in practice these almost never matter.\nIn real-world benchmarks, ArrayList out-performs LinkedList even with big lists and with operations like "lots of insertions near the front."  Academics ignore the fact that real algorithms have constant factors that can overwhelm the asymptotic curve.  For example, linked-lists require an additional object allocation for every node, meaning slower to create a node and vastly worse memory-access characteristics.\nMy rule is:\n\nAlways start with ArrayList and HashSet and HashMap  (i.e. not LinkedList or TreeMap).\nType declarations should always be an interface (i.e. List, Set, Map) so if a profiler or code review proves otherwise you can change the implementation without breaking anything.\n\n', 'questionId': '48442', 'answerId': '48525'}

I believe that SwarmCache, which is integrated with Hibernate, will allow this, but I haven't tried it myself.\nIn general, though, you should know that the contents of a given cache will never be aware of activity by another application (that's why I suggest having both apps share a cache).

An IOException would signal that the client has gone away and processing can be aborted.\nHowever, there may be a few issues with this technique:\n\nSending characters during processing will cause the response to be "committed", so it may be impossible to set HTTP headers, cookies, etc. based on the result of the long-running serverside processing.\nIf the output stream is buffered, the space characters will not be sent immediately, thereby not performing an adequate test.  It may be possible to use flush() as a workaround.\nIt may be difficult to implement this technique for a given framework or view technology (JSP, etc.)  For example, the page rendering code will not be able to sent the content type after the response has been committed.\n\n', 'questionId': '48859', 'answerId': '48882'}

{'answer': u'\nList comprehensions.  I often find myself filtering/mapping lists, and being able to say [line.replace("spam","eggs") for line in open("somefile.txt") if line.startswith("nee")] is really nice.\nFunctions are first class objects.  They can be passed as parameters to other functions, defined inside other function, and have lexical scope.  This makes it really easy to say things like people.sort(key=lambda p: p.age) and thus sort a bunch of people on their age without having to define a custom comparator class or something equally verbose.\nEverything is an object.  Java has basic types which aren\'t objects, which is why many classes in the standard library define 9 different versions of functions (for boolean, byte, char, double, float, int, long, Object, short).  Array.sort is a good example.  Autoboxing helps, although it makes things awkward when something turns out to be null.\nProperties.  Python lets you create classes with read-only fields, lazily-generated fields, as well as fields which are checked upon assignment to make sure they\'re never 0 or null or whatever you want to guard against, etc.\'\nDefault and keyword arguments.  In Java if you want a constructor that can take up to 5 optional arguments, you must define 6 different versions of that constructor.  And there\'s no way at all to say Student(name="Eli", age=25)\nFunctions can only return 1 thing.  In Python you have tuple assignment, so you can say spam, eggs = nee() but in Java you\'d need to either resort to mutable out parameters or have a custom class with 2 fields and then have two additional lines of code to extract those fields.\nBuilt-in syntax for lists and dictionaries.\nOperator Overloading.\nGenerally better designed libraries.  For example, to parse an XML document in Java, you say\nDocument doc = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance().newDocumentBuilder().parse("test.xml");\nand in Python you say\ndoc = parse("test.xml")\n\nAnyway, I could go on and on with further examples, but Python is just overall a much more flexible and expressive language.  It\'s also dynamically typed, which I really like, but which comes with some disadvantages.\nJava has much better performance than Python and has way better tool support.  Sometimes those things matter a lot and Java is the better language than Python for a task; I continue to use Java for some new projects despite liking Python a lot more.  But as a language I think Python is superior for most things I find myself needing to accomplish.\n', 'questionId': '49824', 'answerId': '49953'}

{'answer': u'They don\'t make an Object-Oriented language better. They make practical languages more practical. \nIf you\'re attacking a problem with the OO hammer - represent everything as interactions between objects - then a closure makes no sense. In a class-based OO language, closures are the smoke-filled back rooms where stuff gets done but no one talks about it afterwards. Conceptually, it is abhorrent. \nIn practice, it\'s extremely convenient. I don\'t really want to define a new type of object to hold context, establish the "do stuff" method for it, instantiate it, and populate the context... i just want to tell the compiler, "look, see what i have access to right now?

{'answer': u'Java has had closures since 1.1, just in a very cumbersome and limited way.\nThey are often useful wherever you have a callback of some description. A common case is to abstract away control flow, leaving the interesting code to call an algoritm with a closure that has no external control flow.\nA trivial example is for-each (although Java 1.5 already has that). Whilst you can implement a forEach method in Java as it stands, it\'s far too verbose to be useful.\nAn example which already makes sense with existing Java is implementing the "execute around" idiom, whereby resource acquisition and release is abstracted. For instance, file open and close can be done within try/finally, without the client code having to get the details right.\n', 'questionId': '50255', 'answerId': '50277'}
{'answer': u'As a java developer who is trying to teach themselves lisp in an attempt to become a better programmer, I would say that I would like to see the Josh Block proposal for closures implemented.

{'answer': u'A Hibernate session loads all data it reads from the DB into what they call the first-level cache. Once a row is loaded from the DB, any subsequent fetches for a row with the same PK will return the data from this cache. Furthermore, Hibernate gaurentees reference equality for objects with the same PK in a single Session. \nFrom what I understand, your read-only server application never closes its Hibernate session. So when the DB gets updated by the read-write application, the Session on read-only server is unaware of the change. Effectively, your read-only application is loading an in-memory copy of the database and using that copy, which gets stale in due course.\nThe simplest and best course of action I can suggest is to close and open Sessions as needed. This sidesteps the whole problem. Hibernate Sessions are intended to be a window for a short-lived interaction with the DB. I agree that there is a performance gain by not reloading the object-graph again and again; but you need to measure it and convince yourself that it is worth the pains.\nAnother option is to close and reopen the Session periodically. This ensures that the read-only application works with data not older than a given time interval. But there definitely is a window where the read-only application works with stale data (although the design guarantees that it gets the up-to-date data eventually). This might be permissible in many applications - you need to evaluate your situation. \nThe third option is to use a second level cache implementation, and use short-lived Sessions. There are various caching packages that work with Hibernate with relative merits and demerits.\n', 'questionId': '48733', 'answerId': '50509'}

To make an applet, you have to write code, and there aren\'t any shortcuts.\nNow that flash etc have come along, you can pretty much just drap and drop your way through making a cool animation for your website. This is a much lower barrier for entry - you don\'t have to know how to program in order to get a flash animation working. So flash proliferates, and java applets are hardly used anymore.\n', 'questionId': '51390', 'answerId': '51405'}
{'answer': u'I think applets are collateral damage in the battle between Microsoft and Sun.\nAt first, the JVM was very slow to load and demanded too much memory.\nThen, when increase in computing power made the JVM possible, Sun played hard as it attempted to control all things Java:\n\nAs part of another private antitrust lawsuit filed against Microsoft by Sun in March, Sun sought a preliminary injunction requiring Microsoft to include a current Java virtual machine (JVM) in the Windows XP operating system. Microsoft said the decision to include the JVM this week is a direct result of the latest legal entanglement with Sun, but Microsoft plans to disband support for Java in Windows following Jan. 1, 2004.

{'answer': u'1) AWT made for horrid UIs. Swing improved on that but it was too late, because...\n2) Microsoft dropped support for Java in the browser (its propietary MSJVM), and before it did, it would only support the last version it released, which was roughly JDK 1.1 compatible.\n3) So today you cannot be sure that an applet will run on the majority of non-developer machines, unlike flash.   \nSame can be said of ActiveX by the way.\n', 'questionId': '51390', 'answerId': '51410'}
{'answer': u'The first thing I would do is construct a model of the system to map the data flow and try to understand precisely where the bottleneck lies.  If you can model your system as a pipeline, then you should be able to use the theory of constraints (most of the literature is about optimising business processes but it applies equally to software) to continuously improve performance and eliminate the bottleneck.\nNext I would collect some hard empirical data that accurately characterises the performance of your system. It is something of a clich\xe9 that you cannot manage what you cannot measure, but I have seen many people attempt to optimise a software system based on hunches and fail miserably.\nThen I would use the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) to choose the small number of things that will produce the biggest gains and focus only on those.\nTo scale a Java application horizontally, I have used Oracle Coherence extensively.  Although some dismiss it as a very expensive distributed hashtable, the functionality is much richer than that and you can, for example, directly access data in the cache from C++ code .\nOther alternatives for horizontally scaling your Java code would be Giga Spaces, IBM Object Grid or Gemstone Gemfire.\nIf your C++ code is stateless and is used purely for number crunching, you could look at distributing the process using ICE Grid which has bindings for all of the languages you are using.\n', 'questionId': '51266', 'answerId': '51427'}

{'answer': u"I doubt you want to do it programmatically unless you just want to do it once and store it for future use.  It's a costly thing to do.  There's no sizeof() operator in Java, and even if there was, it would only count the cost of the references to other objects and the size of the primitives.\nOne way you could do it is to serialize the thing to a File and look at the size of the file, like this:\n\nOf course, this assumes that each object is distinct and doesn't contain non-transient references to anything else.\nAnother strategy would be to take each object and examine its members by reflection and add up the sizes (boolean & byte = 1 byte, short & char = 2 bytes, etc.), working your way down the membership hierarchy.  But that's tedious and expensive and ends up doing the same thing the serialization strategy would do.\n", 'questionId': '52353', 'answerId': '52362'}
{'answer': u"There isn't a method call, if that's what you're asking for. With a little research, I suppose you could write your own. A particular instance has a fixed sized derived from the number of references and primitive values plus instance bookkeeping data. You would simply walk the object graph. The less varied the row types, the easier.\nIf that's too slow or just more trouble than it's worth, there's always good old-fashioned  row counting rule-of-thumbs.\n", 'questionId': '52353', 'answerId': '52377'}
{'answer': u'If you would just like to know how much memory is being used in your JVM, and how much is free, you could try something like this:\n\nedit: I thought this might be helpful as the question author also stated he would like to have logic that handles "read as many rows as possible until I\'ve used 32MB of memory."\n', 'questionId': '52353', 'answerId': '52391'}
{'answer': u"You have to walk the objects using reflection.  Be careful as you do:\n\nJust allocating an object has some overhead in the JVM.  The amount varies by JVM so you might make this value a parameter.  At least make it a constant (8 bytes?) and apply to anything allocated.\nJust because byte is theoretically 1 byte doesn't mean it takes just one in memory.\nThere will be loops in object references, so you'll need to keep a HashMap or somesuch using object-equals as the comparator to eliminate infinite loops.\n\n@jodonnell: I like the simplicity of your solution, but many objects aren't Serializable (so this would throw an exception), fields can be transient, and objects can override the standard methods.\n", 'questionId': '52353', 'answerId': '52393'}
{'answer': u"You have to measure it with a tool, or estimate it by hand, and it depends on the JVM you are using.\nThere is some fixed overhead per object. It's JVM-specific, but I usually estimate 40 bytes. Then you have to look at the members of the class. Object references are 4 (8) bytes in a 32-bit (64-bit) JVM. Primitive types are: \n\nboolean and byte: 1 byte\nchar and short: 2 bytes\nint and float: 4 bytes\nlong and double: 8 bytes\n\nArrays follow the same rules; that is, it's an object reference so that takes 4 (or 8) bytes in your object, and then its length multiplied by the size of its element.\nTrying to do it programmatically with calls to Runtime.freeMemory() just doesn't give you much accuracy, because of asynchronous calls to the garbage collector, etc. Profiling the heap with -Xrunhprof or other tools will give you the most accurate results.\n", 'questionId': '52353', 'answerId': '52395'}
{'answer': u'Firstly "the size of an object" isn\'t a well-defined concept in Java. You could mean the object itself, with just its members, the Object and all objects it refers to (the reference graph). You could mean the size in memory or the size on disk. And the JVM is allowed to optimise things like Strings.\nSo the only correct way is to ask the JVM, which a good profiler (I use YourKit), which probably isn\'t what you want.\nHowever, from the description above it sounds like each row will be self-contained, and not have a big dependency tree, so the serialization method will probably be a good approximation on most JVMs. The easiest way to do this is as follows:\n\nRemember that if you have objects with common references this will not give the correct result, and size of serialization will not always match size in memory, but it is a good approximation. The code will be a bit more efficient if you initialise the ByteArrayOutputStream size to a sensible value.\n', 'questionId': '52353', 'answerId': '52401'}

{'answer': u'Some years back Javaworld had an article on determining the size of composite and potentially nested Java objects, they basically walk through creating a sizeof() implementation in Java. The approach basically builds on other work where people experimentally identified the size of primitives and typical Java objects and then apply that knowledge to a method that recursively walks an object graph to tally the total size.\nIt is always going to be somewhat less accurate than a native C implementation simply because of the things going on behind the scenes of a class but it should be a good indicator.\nAlternatively a SourceForge project appropriately called sizeof that offers a Java5 library with a sizeof() implementation.\nP.S.

{'answer': u"You seem to be closing the connection properly - except for the case where prepStmt.close() throws a SQLException, I can't find a connection leak.\nWhat pool implementation are you using?

{'answer': u"Is there any reason why it has to be on a whiteboard?  Personally, I'd rather sit them in front of a keyboard and have them write some code.

At that point windows would minimize the full screen app so that the other application could come to the front. \nThis sounds like it may be a bug (undocumented feature...) in windows.  It should probably not be doing this for a dual screen setup.  \nOne option to fix this is rather than setting it to be "full screen" just make the window the same size as the screen with location (0,0).

{'answer': u"Java doesn't need closures, an Object oriented language can do everything a closure does using intermediate objects to store state or do actions (in Java's case inner classes). \nBut closures are desirable as a feature because they greatly simplify the code and increase readability and as a consequence the maintainability of the code.\nI'm no Java specialist but I'm using  C# 3.5 and closures are one of my favorite features of the language, for example take the following statement as an example:\n\nnow take an equivalent example that doesn't use closures\n\nI know this is C# and not Java but the idea is the same, closures are useful for conciseness, and make code shorter and more readable. Behind the scenes, the closures of C# 3.5 do something that's looks very similar to example #2 meaning the compiler creates a private class behind the scenes and passes the 'filter' parameter to it.\nJava doesn't need closures to work, as a developer you don't need them either, but, they are useful and provide benefits so that means that they are desirable in a language that is a production language and one of it's goals is productivity.\n", 'questionId': '50255', 'answerId': '54180'}

If not, you may need to look elsewhere for the cause of the OOM exception.\nEdit - Regarding:\n\nIn this use case the images can contain sensitive data...\n\nWhen I read through the S3 documentation a few weeks ago, I noticed that you can generate time-expiring keys that can be attached to S3 URLs.  So, you would not have to open up the files on S3 to the public.  My understanding of the technique is:\n\nInitial HTML page has download links to your webapp\nUser clicks on a download link\nYour webapp generates an S3 URL that includes a key that expires in, lets say, 5 minutes.\nSend an HTTP redirect to the client with the URL from step 3.\nThe user downloads the file from S3.  This works even if the download takes more than 5 minutes - once a download starts it can continue through completion.\n\n', 'questionId': '55709', 'answerId': '55788'}

{'answer': u'In addition to what John suggested, you should repeatedly flush the output stream. Depending on your web container, it is possible that it caches parts or even all of your output and flushes it at-once (for example, to calculate the Content-Length header).

{'answer': u"I agree strongly with both toby and John Vasileff--S3 is great for off loading large media objects if you can tolerate the associated issues.  (An instance of own app does that for 10-1000MB FLVs and MP4s.)  E.g.: No partial requests (byte range header), though.  One has to handle that 'manually', occasional down time, etc..\nIf that is not an option, John's code looks good.  I have found that a byte buffer of 2k FILEBUFFERSIZE is the most efficient in microbench marks.  Another option might be a shared FileChannel.  (FileChannels are thread-safe.)\nThat said, I'd also add that guessing at what caused an out of memory error is a classic optimization mistake.  You would improve your chances of success by working with hard metrics.\n\nPlace -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError into you JVM startup parameters, just in case\ntake use jmap on the running JVM (jmap -histo <pid>) under load\nAnalyize the metrics (jmap -histo out put, or have jhat look at your heap dump).  It very well may be that your out of memory is coming from somewhere unexpected.\n\nThere are of course other tools out there, but  jmap & jhat come with Java 5+ 'out of the box'\n\nI've considered writing the file to a local temp drive and then spawning another thread to handle the streaming so that the tomcat servlet thread can be re-used. This seems like it would be io heavy.\n\nAh, I don't think you can't do that.  And even if you could, it sounds dubious.  The tomcat thread that is managing the connection needs to in control.  If you are experiencing thread starvation  then increase the number of available threads in ./conf/server.xml.  Again, metrics are the way to detect this--don't just guess.  \nQuestion: Are you also running on EC2?  What are your tomcat's JVM start up parameters?\n", 'questionId': '55709', 'answerId': '55896'}
{'answer': u'Questioner here, I have got to say getting a tool that does not take 5 minutes to answer any click makes it a lot easier to find potential memory leaks.\nSince people are suggesting several tools ( I only tried visual wm since I got that in the JDK and JProbe trial ) I though I should suggest a free / open source tool built on the Eclipse platform, the Memory Analyzer (sometimes referenced as the SAP memory analyzer) available on http://www.eclipse.org/mat/ . \nWhat is really cool about this tool is that it indexed the heap dump when I first opened it which allowed it to show data like retained heap without waiting 5 minutes for each object (pretty much all operations were tons faster than the other tools I tried).\nWhen you open the dump, the first screen shows you a pie chart with the biggest objects (counting retained heap) and one can quickly navigate down to the objects that are to big for comfort. It also has a Find likely leak suspects which I reccon can come in handy, but since the navigation was enough for me I did not really get into it.\n', 'questionId': '40119', 'answerId': '56031'}

An iterator could be supplying objects from any number of other sources: from a database, from a file, from the network, from some other calculation, etc.\n', 'questionId': '56347', 'answerId': '56396'}
{'answer': u"A pointer to an array element is indeed an iterator into the array.\nAs you say, in Java, an iterator has more knowledge of the underlying container than in C++. C++ iterators are general, and a pair of iterators can denote any range: this can be a sub-range of a container, a range over multiple containers (see http://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/articles/pair_iterators.pdf or http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_36_0/libs/iterator/doc/zip_iterator.html) or even a range of numbers (see http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_36_0/libs/iterator/doc/counting_iterator.html)\nThe iterator categories identify what you can and can't do with a given iterator.\n", 'questionId': '56347', 'answerId': '56401'}
{'answer': u'Enums are supposed to represent the enumeration of all possible values, so extending rather does go against the idea.\nHowever, what you can do in Java (and presumably C++0x) is have an interface instead of a enum class. Then put you standard values in an enum that implements the feature. Obviously you don\'t get to use java.util.EnumSet and the like. This is the approach taken in "more NIO features", which should be in JDK7.\n\n', 'questionId': '55375', 'answerId': '56413'}
{'answer': u"Perhaps a bit more theoretical. Mathematically, collections in C++ can be described as a half-open interval of iterators, namely one iterator pointing to the start of the collection and one iterator pointing just behind the last element.\nThis convention opens up a host of possibilities. The way algorithms work in C++, they can all be applied to subsequences of a larger collection. To make such a thing work in Java, you have to create a wrapper around an existing collection that returns a different iterator.\nAnother important aspect of iterators has already been mentioned by Frank. There are different concepts of iterators. Java iterators correspond to C++' input iterators, i.e. they are read-only iterators that can only be incremented one step at a time and can't go backwards.\nOn the other extreme, you have C pointers which correspond exactly to C++' concept of a random access iterator.\nAll in all, C++ offers a much richer and purer concept that can be applied to a much wider variety of tasks than either C pointers or Java iterators.\n", 'questionId': '56347', 'answerId': '56419'}
{'answer': u'C++ library (the part formerly known as STL) iterators are designed to be compatible with pointers. Java, without pointer arithmetic, had the freedom to be more programmer-friendly.\nIn C++ you end up having to use a pair of iterators. In Java you either use an iterator or a collection. Iterators are supposed to be the glue between algorithm and data structure. Code written for 1.5+ rarely need mention iterators, unless it is implementing a particular algorithm or data structure (which the vary majority of programmers have no need to do).

{'answer': u'The overhead is very small. It is possible to write a hybrid array list that has fields for the first few items, and then falls back to using an array for longer list.\nYou can avoid the overhead of the list object entirely by using an array.

{'answer': u'Hibernate makes more sense when your application works on object graphs, which are persisted in the RDBMS. Instead, if your application logic works on a 2-D matrix of data, fetching those via direct JDBC works better. Although Hibernate is written on top of JDBC, it has capabilities which might be non-trivial to implement in JDBC. For eg:\n\nSay, the user views a row in the UI and changes some of the values and you want to fire an update query for only those columns that did indeed change.\nTo avoid getting into deadlocks you need to maintain a global order for SQLs in a transaction. Getting this right JDBC might not be easy\nEasily setting up optimistic locking. When you use JDBC, you need to remember to have this in every update query.\nBatch updates, lazy materialization of collections etc might also be non-trivial to implement in JDBC.\n\n(I say "might be non-trivial", because it of course can be done - and you might be a super hacker:)\nHibernate lets you fire your own SQL queries also, in case you need to. \nHope this helps you to decide.\nPS: Keeping the Session open on a remote desktop client and running into trouble is really not Hibernate\'s problem - you would run into the same issue if you keep the Connection to the DB open for long.\n', 'questionId': '58163', 'answerId': '58276'}

The important thing is that removeAbandonedTimeout is less than maxWait.\nIs this what should be happening? ie Is this the way that the pool should operate?

Sitting on top of the respective runtime environments are a set of class libraries that provide higher level abstractions to developers to simplify development tasks.\nThe internals of how those runtime environments are actually implemented are, for the most part, proprietary to Microsoft and Sun.

{'answer': u"Sounds to me like you are treating a symptom: poor design with dependencies on static initialization.  Maybe some refactoring is the real solution.

{'answer': u"Well....Java is actually more portable.  Mono isn't implemented everywhere, and it lags behind the Microsoft implementation significantly.  The Java SDK seems to stay in better sync across platforms (and it works on more platforms).  \nI'd also say Java has more tool availability across all those platforms, although there are plenty of tools available for .NET on Windows platforms.\nUpdate for 2014\nI still hold this opinion in 2014.  However, I'll qualify this by saying I'm just now starting to pay some attention to Mono after a long while of not really caring, so there may be improvements in the Mono runtime (or ecosystem) that I haven't been made aware of. AFAIK, there is still no support for WPF, WCF, WF, of WIF. Mono can run on iOS, but to my knowledge, the Java runtime still runs on far more platforms than Mono.  Also, Mono is starting to see some much improved tooling (Xamarin), and Microsoft seems to have a much more cross-platform kind of attitude and willingness to work with partners to make them complimentary, rather than competitive (for example, Mono will be a pretty important part of the upcoming OWIN/Helios ASP.NET landscape).

I personally would not like to switch between non-English language and English while reading code.\nHowever, if your database, UI, business logics (including metaphors) are already in some non-English language, there's no need to translate every method names and variables into English.\n", 'questionId': '61615', 'answerId': '61619'}
{'answer': u"It depends:\n\nDoes your team conform to any existing standards that require your using ASCII?\nIs your code ever going to be feasibly reused or read by someone who doesn't speak your native language?\nDo you envision a scenario where you'll need to ask for help online and will therefore not be able to copy-paste your code sample in as-is?\nAre you certain your entire suite of tools support code encoding?\n\nIf you answered 'yes' to any of the above, stay ASCII only.  If not, go forward at your own risk.\n", 'questionId': '61615', 'answerId': '61620'}
{'answer': u'I would stick to english, simply because you usually never know who is working on that code, and because some third-party tools used in the build/testing/bugtracking progress may have problems. Typing \xe4\xf6\xfc\xdf on a Non-German Keyboard is simply a PITA, and I simply believe that anyone involved in software development should speak english, but maybe that\'s just my arrogance as a non-native-english speaker.\nWhat you call "American arrogance" is not whether or not your program uses international variable names, it\'s when your program thinks "W\xe4hrung" and "Wahrung" are the same words.\n', 'questionId': '61615', 'answerId': '61624'}
{'answer': u"IF you get past the other prerequisites you then have one extra (IMHO more important) one - How difficult is the symbol to type.\nOn my regular en-us keyboard, the only way I know of to type the letter \xe7 is to hold alt, and hit 0227 on the numeric keypad, or copy and paste.\nThis would be a HUGE big roadblock in the way of typing quickly. You don't want to slow your coding down with trivial stuff like this if you aren't forced to. International keyboards may alleviate this, but then what happens if you have to code on your laptop which doesn't have an international keyboard, etc?\n", 'questionId': '61615', 'answerId': '61630'}
{'answer': u"I used to work in a development team that happily wiped their asses with any naming (and for that matter any other coding) conventions. Believe it or not, having to cope with \xe4's and \xf6's in the code was a contributing factor of me resigning. Though I'm Finnish, I prefer writing code with US keyboard settings because curly and square brackets are a pain to write in a Finnish keyboard (try right alt and 7 and 0 for curlies).\nSo I say stick with the ascii characters.\n", 'questionId': '61615', 'answerId': '61641'}
{'answer': u'Just for fun, a solution using the jsr166y fork-join framework that should in JDK7.\n\n(Disclaimer: Not compiled. Spec is not finalised.

{'answer': u"As far as I know you need to start using JNI to set up a message handler for the Windows WM_QUERYENDSESSION message.\nTo do this (if you're new to Windows programming like me) you'll need to create a new class of window with a new message handling function (as described here) and handle the WM_QUERYENDSESSION from the message handler.\nNB: You'll need to use the JNIEnv::GetJavaVM(...) and then JavaVM::AttachCurrentThread(...) on the message handling thread before you can call any Java methods from your native message handling code. \n", 'questionId': '61692', 'answerId': '61694'}
{'answer': u"For handling uncaught exceptions you can provide a new ThreadGroup which provides an implementation of ThreadGroup.uncaughtException(...). You can then catch any uncaught exceptions and handle them appropriately (e.g. send a crash log home).\nI can't help you on the JNI front, there's probably a way using a native wrapper executable before calling the JVM, but that executable is going to need to know about all the possible JVMs it could be calling and how the indicate crashes and where crash logs are placed etc.\n", 'questionId': '61714', 'answerId': '61715'}
{'answer': u'Not sure if this is what you needing, but you can also detect if an exception has occurred from within your native code.  See http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/functions.html#wp5234 for more info.\n', 'questionId': '61714', 'answerId': '61717'}
{'answer': u"I'm going to say Java as well. If you look at it in terms of maturity, a lot more time and effort has been expended by Sun (and others) in getting the JVM to work on non-Windows platforms. \nIn contrast, Mono is definitely a second class citizen in the .NET ecosystem.\nDepending on who your target customers are, you may also find there is real pushback against using Mono - does Novell offer the same kind of vendor support for Mono that you would get for Java or .NET on Windows?\nIf you were primarily targeting hosting your service on Windows, it would make sense to be considering this choice, but since you're targeting Linux primarily, it seems like kind of a no-brainer to me.\n", 'questionId': '61559', 'answerId': '61724'}
{'answer': u"The java.lang.management package does give you a whole lot more info than Runtime - for example it will give you heap memory (ManagementFactory.getMemoryMXBean().getHeapMemoryUsage()) separate from non-heap memory (ManagementFactory.getMemoryMXBean().getNonHeapMemoryUsage()).\nYou can also get process CPU usage (without writing your own JNI code), but you need to cast the java.lang.management.OperatingSystemMXBean to a com.sun.management.OperatingSystemMXBean.

{'answer': u"As of version 1.4, I have been running all my server side code, in my container of choice (Glassfish) and hooking up the GWTShell to that. Are you using Netbeans, Eclipse or something else? The Netbeans plugin gwt4nb does this for you out of the box, you just have to start your web project in debug mode. I'm sure the GWT plugin for Eclipse does the same thing.\nI realise this doesn't directly answer your question -> but my question is, is there a reason you're trying to get GWT to pick up your database settings and not just running your project as normal instead. I find this much better and robust way of running the GWTShell.\nEdit: Sorry I don't really use Eclipse, so I can't help you with plugins for it. I find Netbeans far superior for J2EE/web type projects. It's a bit slower, but far more functional. The plugin for that is called 'GWT4NB', it's free and it will set up your ant script in such a way that you just have to right-click on your web project and choose debug. I can understand if you don't want to switch IDEs though.\n", 'questionId': '59806', 'answerId': '61761'}
{'answer': u"For simple catch-all handling, you can use the following static method in Thread. From the Javadoc:\n\nstatic void setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler(Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler eh) \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Set the default handler invoked when a thread abruptly terminates due to an uncaught exception, and no other handler has been defined for that thread.\n\nThis is a very broad way to deal with errors or unchecked exceptions that may not be caught anywhere else.\nSide-note: It's better if the code can catch, log and/or recover from exceptions closer to the source of the problem. I would reserve this kind of generalized crash handling for totally unrecoverable situations (i.e. subclasses of java.lang.Error). Try to avoid the possibility of a RuntimeException ever going completely uncaught, since it might be possible--and preferable--for the software to survive that.\n", 'questionId': '61714', 'answerId': '61806'}

{'answer': u'I would vote for Java being more portable than C#.  Java definitely also has a very rich set of standard libraries.  There is also a broad set of open source 3rd party libraries out there such as those provided by the Jakarta project (http://jakarta.apache.org/).\nAll the usual suspects exist for CI, Unit testing, etc too.  Cross platform IDE support is also very good with the likes of Eclipse, Netbeans, IntelliJ IDEA etc.\n', 'questionId': '61559', 'answerId': '61815'}
{'answer': u'To add a bit more to the conversation, Java is more portable if you remain about one version behind - Java 5 still has many excellent features so you can wait for Java 6 and still have a lot of range in terms of language and libraries to develop with.  The Mac is the primary platform that can take some time to catch up to the latest Java version.\nJava also has an excellent standards body that intelligently grows the platform based on input from many different companies.  This is an oft overlooked feature but it keeps even new features working well across multiple platforms and provides a lot of range in library support for some esoteric things (as optional extensions).\n', 'questionId': '61559', 'answerId': '61829'}
{'answer': u"I've been asking the same question off-late and IMHO, .NET/Mono seems to be a better option simply because Mono has a great track record for cross-platform desktop applications (as opposed to Java) and of course, Mono is improving by leaps and bounds these days.\n", 'questionId': '61559', 'answerId': '61852'}
{'answer': u'I think the answer is "it depends."  Java runs on just about anything, but .NET/Mono are (IMHO) a better framework for the desktop.  So I guess the answer really depends on what platforms you plan on targeting.\n', 'questionId': '61559', 'answerId': '61866'}

The Alert remains on the display until a Command is invoked.\n\nThese are built-in classes supported in MIDP 1.0 and higher. Also your code snippet will never work. Such an API would need to block the calling thread awaiting for the user to select and answer.

{'answer': u'Connection reset simply means that a TCP RST was received. This happens when your peer receives data that it can\'t process, and there can be various reasons for that.\nThe simplest is when you close the socket, and then write more data on the output stream. By closing the socket, you told your peer that you are done talking, and it can forget about your connection. When you send more data on that stream anyway, the peer rejects it with an RST to let you know it isn\'t listening.\nIn other cases, an intervening firewall or even the remote host itself might "forget" about your TCP connection. This could happen if you don\'t send any data for a long time (2 hours is a common time-out), or because the peer was rebooted and lost its information about active connections. Sending data on one of these defunct connections will cause a RST too.\n\nUpdate in response to additional information: \nTake a close look at your handling of the SocketTimeoutException. This exception is raised if the configured timeout is exceeded while blocked on a socket operation. The state of the socket itself is not changed when this exception is thrown, but if your exception handler closes the socket, and then tries to write to it, you\'ll be in a connection reset condition. setSoTimeout() is meant to give you a clean way to break out of a read() operation that might otherwise block forever, without doing dirty things like closing the socket from another thread.\n', 'questionId': '62929', 'answerId': '63155'}

{'answer': u"Rather than using a third party tool, you can also make a pretty good guess by looking at all the columns in task manager if you know roughly what the various java processes on your system are. From the Processes tab, use View-> Select Columns and add PID, CPU Time, VM Size, and Thread count. Knowing roughly what the process is doing should help narrow it down. \nFor example, in a client-server app, the server will likely use more memory, have more threads, and have used more CPU time because it has been running longer. If you're killing a process because it's stuck, it might simply be using more CPU right now. \nMAX java heap memory is usually directly reflected in VM Size.

{'answer': u"There are some very useful 'higher order functions' which can do operations on lists using closures. Higher order functions are functions having 'function objects' as parameters.\nE.g. it is a very common operation to apply some transformation to every element in a list. This higher order function is commonly called 'map' or 'collect'. (See the *. spread operator of Groovy).\nFor example to square each element in a list without closures you would probably write:\n\nUsing closures and map and the proposed syntax, you could write it like that:\n\n(There is a possible performance problem here regarding boxing of primitive types.)\nAs explained by Pop Catalin there is another higher order function called 'select' or 'filter': It can be used to get all the elements in a list complying to some condition.

{'answer': u"I recommend the web service route. It offers a standard interface that can be consumed by other client platforms in the future.\n.NET clients interact with Java web services pretty well, though there are some gotchas. The best two technologies available for you for the .NET client are Microsoft Web Service Enhancements (WSE) and Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). WSE is an older technology that is no longer being updated by Microsoft, but still works great in Visual Studio 2005 and older. I find WSE to be a bit easier to get started with in terms of how you interface with basic services, but WCF has much more support for WS-* protocols (security, trust, etc.). If your needs are basic and you're still using Visual Studio 2005 (.NET framework 2 or older), then go with WSE. If you like the cutting edge, or you anticipate more advanced security needs (doesn't sound like you will), then go with WCF. Please note that WSE will not work easily in Visual Studio 2008 and newer, and WCF will not work in Visual Studio 2005 and older.\nGoing the web service route will mean that you will design to an interface that can be reused and will result in a more loosely coupled system when you're done than most of the other routes. The downside is primarily performance: xml serialization will be slower than binary over the wire, and web services do not handle large amounts of data well.\n", 'questionId': '64454', 'answerId': '64535'}

{'answer': u"Using NodeEnvelopes or edge/node Factories sounds like overdesign to me.\nDo you really want to expose a setName() method on Node at all?  There's nothing in your example to suggest that you need that.  If you make both your Node and Edge classes immutable, most of the integrity-violation scenarios you're envisioning become impossible.  (If you need them to be mutable but only until they're added to a Graph, you could enforce this by having an isInGraph flag on your Node/Edge classes that is set to true by Graph.Add{Node, Edge}, and have your mutators throw an exception if called after this flag is set.)\nI agree with jhkiley that passing Node objects to the Edge constructor (instead of Strings) sounds like a good idea.\nIf you want a more intrusive approach, you could have a pointer from the Node class back to the Graph it resides in, and update the Graph if any critical properties (e.g., the name) of the Node ever change.

{'answer': u"A perfect JVM implementation will never crash.\nTo crash a JVM, aside from JNI, you need to find a bug in the VM itself.  An infinite loop just consumes CPU.

{'answer': u'Every programming language has its own set of rules and conventions for the kinds of names that you\'re allowed to use, and the Java programming language is no different. The rules and conventions for naming your variables can be summarized as follows:\n\nVariable names are case-sensitive. A variable\'s name can be any legal identifier \u2014 an unlimited-length sequence of Unicode letters and digits, beginning with a letter, the dollar sign "$", or the underscore character "_". The convention, however, is to always begin your variable names with a letter, not "$" or "_". Additionally, the dollar sign character, by convention, is never used at all. You may find some situations where auto-generated names will contain the dollar sign, but your variable names should always avoid using it. A similar convention exists for the underscore character; while it\'s technically legal to begin your variable\'s name with "_", this practice is discouraged. White space is not permitted.\nSubsequent characters may be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscore characters. Conventions (and common sense) apply to this rule as well. When choosing a name for your variables, use full words instead of cryptic abbreviations. Doing so will make your code easier to read and understand. In many cases it will also make your code self-documenting; fields named cadence, speed, and gear, for example, are much more intuitive than abbreviated versions, such as s, c, and g. Also keep in mind that the name you choose must not be a keyword or reserved word.\nIf the name you choose consists of only one word, spell that word in all lowercase letters. If it consists of more than one word, capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word. The names gearRatio and currentGear are prime examples of this convention. If your variable stores a constant value, such as static final int NUM_GEARS = 6, the convention changes slightly, capitalizing every letter and separating subsequent words with the underscore character. By convention, the underscore character is never used elsewhere. \n\nFrom the official Java Tutorial\n', 'questionId': '65475', 'answerId': '65531'}

This wasn\'t true before Java 1.4.2, because when concatenating more than two strings using the "+" operator, intermediate String objects would be created during the process of building the final string.\nHowever, as the JavaDoc for StringBuffer states, at least since Java 1.4.2 using the "+" operator compiles down to creating a StringBuffer and append()ing the many strings to it. So no difference, apparently.\nHowever, be careful when using adding a string to another inside a loop! For example:\n\nKeep in mind, however, that usually concatenating a few strings with "+" is cleaner than append()ing them all.\n', 'questionId': '65668', 'answerId': '65677'}

{'answer': u"Java turns string1 + string2 into a StringBuffer construct, append(), and toString().  This makes sense.\nHowever, in Java 1.4 and earlier, it would do this for each + operator in the statement separately.  This meant that doing a + b + c would result in two StringBuffer constructs with two toString() calls.  If you had a long string of concats, it would turn into a real mess.  Doing it yourself meant you could control this and do it properly.\nJava 5.0 and above seem to do it more sensibly, so it's less of a problem and is certainly less verbose.\n", 'questionId': '65668', 'answerId': '65717'}
{'answer': u"To concatenate two strings using '+', a new string needs to be allocated with space for both strings, and then the data copied over from both strings.  A StringBuffer is optimized for concatenating, and allocates more space than needed initially.  When you concatenate a new string, in most cases, the characters can simply be copied to the end of the existing string buffer.\nFor concatenating two strings, the '+' operator will probably have less overhead, but as you concatenate more strings, the StringBuffer will come out ahead, using fewer memory allocations, and less copying of data.\n", 'questionId': '65668', 'answerId': '65719'}
{'answer': u"It's better to use StringBuilder (it's an unsynchronized version; when do you build strings in parallel?) these days, in almost every case, but here's what happens:\nWhen you use + with two strings, it compiles code like this:\n\nTo something like this:\n\nTherefore for just little examples, it usually doesn't make a difference. But when you're building a complex string, you've often got a lot more to deal with than this; for example, you might be using many different appending statements, or a loop like this:\n\nIn this case, a new StringBuilder instance, and a new String (the new value of out - Strings are immutable) is required in each iteration.

{'answer': u"The StringBuffer class maintains an array of characters to hold the contents of the strings you concatenate, whereas the + method creates a new string each time its called and appends the two parameters (param1 + param2).\nThe StringBuffer is faster because 1. it might be able to use its already existing array to concat/store all of the strings. 2. even if they don't fit in the array, its faster to allocate a larger backing array then to generate new String objects for each evocation.\n", 'questionId': '65668', 'answerId': '65730'}

{'answer': u'Because Strings are immutable, each call to the + operator creates a new String object and copies the String data over to the new String.  Since copying a String takes time linear in the length of the String, a sequence of N calls to the + operator results in O(N2) running time (quadratic).\nConversely, since a StringBuffer is mutable, it does not need to copy the String every time you perform an Append(), so a sequence of N Append() calls takes O(N) time (linear).

{'answer': u'In some cases this is obsolete due to optimisations performed by the compiler, but the general issue is that code like:\n\nwill act as below (each step being the next loop iteration):\n\nconstruct a string object of length 1, and value "x"\nCreate a new string object of size 2, copy the old string "x" into it, add "x" in position 2.\nCreate a new string object of size 3, copy the old string "xx" into it, add "x" in position 3.\n... and so on\n\nAs you can see, each iteration is having to copy one more character, resulting in us performing 1+2+3+4+5+...+N operations each loop.  This is an O(n^2) operation. If however we knew in advance that we only needed N characters, we could do it in a single allocation, with copy of just N characters from the strings we were using - a mere O(n) operation.\nStringBuffer/StringBuilder avoid this because they are mutable, and so do not need to keep copying the same data over and over (so long as there is space to copy into in their internal buffer).  They avoid performing an allocation and copy proportional to the number of appends done by over-allocing their buffer by a proportion of its current size, giving amortized O(1) appending.\nHowever its worth noting that often the compiler will be able to optimise code into StringBuilder style (or better - since it can perform constant folding etc.) automatically.\n', 'questionId': '65668', 'answerId': '65964'}

Instead:\n\nIf you have access to Java 5+, use enums to define your specific constants for an application area.  All parts of the application area should refer to enums, not constant values, for these constants.  You may declare an enum similar to how you declare a class.

Avoiding this pattern even has its own item (#18) in Bloch's Effective Java.\nAn argument Bloch makes against the constant interface pattern is that use of constants is an implementation detail, but implementing an interface to use them exposes that implementation detail in your exported API.\nThe public|private static final TYPE NAME = VALUE; pattern is a good way of declaring a constant. Personally, I think it's better to avoid making a separate class to house all of your constants, but I've never seen a reason not to do this, other than personal preference and style.\nIf your constants can be well-modeled as an enumeration, consider the enum structure available in 1.5 or later.\nIf you're using a version earlier than 1.5, you can still pull off typesafe enumerations by using normal Java classes.

So you'll end up with:\n\nThis is very old school TopLink btw ;)\nNote that the batch will help a lot, because batch writing and more especially batch writing with parameter binding will kick in which for this simple example will probably have a very large impact on your performance.\nOther things to look for: your sequencing size. A lot of the time spent writing objects in TopLink is actually spent reading sequencing information from the database, especially with the small defaults (I would probably have several hundred or even more as my sequence size).\n", 'questionId': '64781', 'answerId': '66373'}

The AOP approach is better than copy-and-pasting the FocusListener to your entire code because you keep it all in a single piece of code, and don't create a maintenance nightmare once you decide to change your global behavior like removing the listener for JSpinners.\nThere are many AOP frameworks out there to choose from.

Dependencies between the different project modules clearly separate things (e.g., the web layer depends on the service layer but doesn\'t know about the repository layer).\nEach module has its own base package, for example if the application package is "com.foo.bar", then we have:\n\nEach module respects the standard maven project structure:\n\nUnit tests for a given layer easily find their place under \\src\\test... Everything that is domain specific has it\'s place in the entities module. Now something like a FileStorageStrategy should go into the repositories module, since we don\'t need to know exactly what the implementation is. In the services layer, we only know the repository interface, we do not care what the specific implementation is (separation of concerns).\nThere are multiple advantages to this approach:\n\nclear separation of concerns\neach module is packageable as a jar (or a war in the case of the web module) and thus allows for easier code reuse (e.g., we could install the module in the maven repository and reuse it in another project)\nmaximum independence of each part of the project\n\nI know this doesn\'t answer all your questions, but I think this could put you on the right path and could prove useful to others.\n', 'questionId': '7596', 'answerId': '66745'}

{'answer': u"The short answer is, you're not missing anything.  The Android SDK doesn't provide a direct method to change the indicator of a TabHost after it's been created.  The TabSpec is only used to build the tab, so changing the TabSpec after the fact will have no effect.\nI think there's a workaround, though.  Call mTabs.getTabWidget() to get a TabWidget object.  This is just a subclass of ViewGroup, so you can call getChildCount() and getChildAt() to access individual tabs within the TabWidget.  Each of these tabs is also a View, and in the case of a tab with a graphical indicator and a text label, it's almost certainly some other ViewGroup (maybe a LinearLayout, but it doesn't matter) that contains an ImageView and a TextView.  So with a little fiddling with the debugger or Log.i, you should be able to figure out a recipe to get the ImageView and change it directly.\nThe downside is that if you're not careful, the exact layout of the controls within a tab could change and your app could break.

{'answer': u'Okay, I found where I read that.  This is all from "Learning Java" (O\'Reilly 2005):\n\nThe problem with a traditional JIT compilation is that optimizing code takes time. So a JIT compiler can produce decent results but may suffer a significant latency when the application starts up. This is generally not a problem for long-running server-side applications but is a serious problem for client-side software and applications run on smaller devices with limited capabilities. To address this, Sun\'s compiler technology, called HotSpot, uses a trick called adaptive compilation. If you look at what programs actually spend their time doing, it turns out that they spend almost all their time executing a relatively small part of the code again and again. The chunk of code that is executed repeatedly may be only a small fraction of the total program, but its behavior determines the program\'s overall performance. Adaptive compilation also allows the Java runtime to take advantage of new kinds of optimizations that simply can\'t be done in a statically compiled language, hence the claim that Java code can run faster than C/C++ in some cases.\nTo take advantage of this fact, HotSpot starts out as a normal Java bytecode interpreter, but with a difference: it measures (profiles) the code as it is executing to see what parts are being executed repeatedly. Once it knows which parts of the code are crucial to performance, HotSpot compiles those sections into optimal native machine code. Since it compiles only a small portion of the program into machine code, it can afford to take the time necessary to optimize those portions. The rest of the program may not need to be compiled at all\u2014just interpreted\u2014saving memory and time. In fact, Sun\'s default Java VM can run in one of two modes: client and server, which tell it whether to emphasize quick startup time and memory conservation or flat out performance.\nA natural question to ask at this point is, Why throw away all this good profiling information each time an application shuts down? Well, Sun has partially broached this topic with the release of Java 5.0 through the use of shared, read-only classes that are stored persistently in an optimized form. This significantly reduces both the startup time and overhead of running many Java applications on a given machine. The technology for doing this is complex, but the idea is simple: optimize the parts of the program that need to go fast, and don\'t worry about the rest.\n\nI\'m kind of wondering how far Sun has gotten with it since Java 5.0.\n', 'questionId': '68109', 'answerId': '68199'}

Its primary benefit is to improve startup performance.  The IBM VM by default JITs a method after it's been called 1000 times.  If it knows that a method is going to be called 1000 times just during the VM startup (think a commonly-used method like java.lang.String.equals(...) ), then it's beneficial for it to store that in the AOT cache so that it never has to waste time compiling at runtime.\n", 'questionId': '68109', 'answerId': '68602'}

{'answer': u"My suggestion would be to find the rare pages that do not require an import of other JSPs, or have very few imports.  Treat each JSP imported as a black box, and refactor these pages around them (iteratively, testing each change and making sure it works before continuing).  Once these are cleaned up, you can continue finding pages with more and more imports, until finally you have refactored the imports.\nWhen refactoring, note the parts that try to access resources not given to the page and try to take this out to a controller.  For instance, anything that accesses the database should be inside a controller, let the JSP handle the display of the information the controller gives to it via a forward.  In this way you will develop several servlets, or things like servlets, for each page.  I would suggest using a front-controller based framework for this refactoring (from personal experience I recommend Spring and its Controller interface), so that each controller isn't a separate Servlet but is rather delegated to from a single servlet that is mapped appropriately.\nFor the controller, it is better to do database hits all at once rather than attempt them piecemeal.  Users can and generally do tolerate a page load, but the page output will be much faster if all the database data is given to the rendering code rather than the rendering code hanging and not giving data to the client while it is trying to read yet another piece of data from the database.\nI feel your pain and wish you luck in this endeavor.

{'answer': u"I agree that the performance difference seen by the poster is most likely caused by disk latency bringing the JRE into memory.  The Just In Time compiler (JIT) would not have an impact on performance of a little application.\nJava 1.6u10 (http://download.java.net/jdk6/) touches the runtime JARs in a background process (even if Java isn't running) to keep the data in the disk cache.  This significantly decreases startup times (Which is a huge benefit to desktop apps, but probably of marginal value to server side apps).\nOn large, long running applications, the JIT makes a big difference over time - but the amount of time required for the JIT to accumulate sufficient statistics to kick in and optimize (5-10 seconds) is very, very short compared to the overall life of the application (most run for months and months).  While storing and restoring the JIT results is an interesting academic exercise, the practical improvement is not very large (Which is why the JIT team has been more focused on things like GC strategies for minimizing memory cache misses, etc...).\nThe pre-compilation of the runtime classes does help desktop applications quite a bit (as does the aforementioned 6u10 disk cache pre-loading).\n", 'questionId': '68109', 'answerId': '69412'}
{'answer': u"Your loop looks valid - what does the following code (just on it's own) return?\n\nif it's returning -1, then the zipStream is closed before you get it, and all bets are off.  It's time to use your debugger and make sure what's being passed to you is actually valid.\nWhen you call getNextEntry(), does it return a value, and is the data in the entry meaningful (i.e. does getCompressedSize() return a valid value)?  IF you are just reading a Zip file that doesn't have read-ahead zip entries embedded, then ZipInputStream isn't going to work for you.\nSome useful tidbits about the Zip format:\nEach file embedded in a zip file has a header.  This header can contain useful information (such as the compressed length of the stream, it's offset in the file, CRC) - or it can contain some magic values that basically say 'The information isn't in the stream header, you have to check the Zip post-amble'.\nEach zip file then has a table that is attached to the end of the file that contains all of the zip entries, along with the real data.  The table at the end is mandatory, and the values in it must be correct.  In contrast, the values embedded in the stream do not have to be provided.\nIf you use ZipFile, it reads the table at the end of the zip.  If you use ZipInputStream, I suspect that getNextEntry() attempts to use the entries embedded in the stream.  If those values aren't specified, then ZipInputStream has no idea how long the stream might be.  The inflate algorithm is self terminating (you actually don't need to know the uncompressed length of the output stream in order to fully recover the output), but it's possible that the Java version of this reader doesn't handle this situation very well.\nI will say that it's fairly unusual to have a servlet returning a ZipInputStream (it's much more common to receive an inflatorInputStream if you are going to be receiving compressed content.\n", 'questionId': '67275', 'answerId': '69489'}

{'answer': u'From using third party libraries on Windows I\'ve learned the following two things:\nTry to distribute your library as a DLL rather than a static library. This gives way better compatibility between different c compilers and linkers. Another problem with static libraries in visual c++ is that the choice of runtime library can make libraries incompatible with code using a different runtime library and you may end up needing to distribute one version of the library for each runtime library.\nAvoid c++ if possible. The c++ name mangling differs alot between different compilers and it\'s unlikely that a library built for visual c++ will be possible to link from another build environment in windows. When it comes to C, things are much better, in particular if you use dll\'s.\nIf you really want to get the good parts of c++ (such as resource management through constructors and destructors), build a convenience layer in c++ that you distribute as source code that hides away your c functions. Since the user has the source and compiles it locally, it won\'t have any name mangiling or abi issues with the local environment.\nWithout knowing too much about calling c/c++ code from Java, I expect it to be way easier to work with c code than c++ code because of the name mangling issues.\nThe book "Imperfect C++" has some discussion on library compatibility that I found very helpful.\n', 'questionId': '62398', 'answerId': '71496'}

{'answer': u'I just noticed you referenced my article.\nThe Java Spec says that everything in Java is pass-by-value. There is no such thing as "pass-by-reference" in Java.\nThe key to understanding this is that something like\n\nis not a Dog; it\'s actually a pointer to a Dog.\nWhat that means, is when you have\n\nyou\'re essentially passing the address of the created Dog object to the foo method.\n(I say essentially because Java pointers aren\'t direct addresses, but it\'s easiest to think of them that way)\nSuppose the Dog object resides at memory address 42. This means we pass 42 to the method.\nif the Method were defined as\n\nlet\'s look at what\'s happening.\n\nthe parameter someDog is set to the value 42\nat line "AAA"\n\n\nsomeDog is followed to the Dog it points to (the Dog object at address 42)\nthat Dog (the one at address 42) is asked to change his name to Max\n\nat line "BBB"\n\n\na new Dog is created. Let\'s say he\'s at address 74\nwe assign the parameter someDog to 74 \n\nat line "CCC"\n\n\nsomeDog is followed to the Dog it points to (the Dog object at address 74)\nthat Dog (the one at address 74) is asked to change his name to Rowlf\n\nthen, we return\n\nNow let\'s think about what happens outside the method:\nDid myDog change?\nThere\'s the key.\nKeeping in mind that myDog is a pointer, and not an actual Dog, the answer is NO. myDog still has the value 42; it\'s still pointing to the original Dog (but note that because of line "AAA", its name is now "Max" - still the same Dog; myDog\'s value has not changed.)\nIt\'s perfectly valid to follow an address and change what\'s at the end of it; that does not change the variable, however.\nJava works exactly like C. You can assign a pointer, pass the pointer to a method, follow the pointer in the method and change the data that was pointed to. However, you cannot change where that pointer points.\nIn C++, Ada, Pascal and other languages that support pass-by-reference, you can actually change the variable that was passed.\nIf Java had pass-by-reference semantics, the foo method we defined above would have changed where myDog was pointing when it assigned someDog on line BBB.\nThink of reference parameters as being aliases for the variable passed in. When that alias is assigned, so is the variable that was passed in.\n', 'questionId': '40480', 'answerId': '73021'}

{'answer': u'Garbage collection is faster (more time efficient) than reference counting, if you have enough memory. For example, a copying gc traverses the "live" objects and copies them to a new space, and can reclaim all the "dead" objects in one step by marking a whole memory region. This is very efficient, if you have enough memory. Generational collections use the knowledge that "most objects die young"; often only a few percent of objects have to be copied.\n[This is also the reason why gc can be faster than malloc/free]\nReference counting is much more space efficient than garbage collection, since it reclaims memory the very moment it gets unreachable. This is nice when you want to attach finalizers to objects (e.g. to close a file once the File object gets unreachable). A reference counting system can work even when only a few percent of the memory is free. But the management cost of having to increment and decrement counters upon each pointer assignment cost a lot of time, and some kind of garbage collection is still needed to reclaim cycles.\nSo the trade-off is clear: if you have to work in a memory-constrained environment, or if you need precise finalizers, use reference counting. If you have enough memory and need the speed, use garbage collection.\n', 'questionId': '21934', 'answerId': '74327'}

{'answer': u"I wouldn't call throwing an OutOfMemoryError or StackOverflowError a crash. These are just normal exceptions. To really crash a VM there are 3 ways:\n\nUse JNI and crash in the native code.\nIf no security manager is installed you can use reflection to crash the VM. This is VM specific, but normally a VM stores a bunch of pointers to native resources in private fields (e.g. a pointer to the native thread object is stored in a long field in java.lang.Thread). Just change them via reflection and the VM will crash sooner or later.\nAll VMs have bugs, so you just have to trigger one.\n\nFor the last method I have a short example, which will crash a Sun Hotspot VM quiet nicely:\n\nThis leads to a stack overflow in the GC so you will get no StackOverflowError but a real crash including a hs_err* file.\n", 'questionId': '65200', 'answerId': '74780'}
{'answer': u'If you define a crash as an process abort because of a unhandled situation (i.e. no Java Exception or Error), then this can not be done from within Java (unless you have permission to use the sun.misc.Unsafe class). This the whole point of managed code.\nTypical crashes in native code happen by de-referencing pointers to wrong memory areas (null address or missaligned). Another source could be illegal machine instructions (opcodes) or unhandled signals from library or kernel calls. Both can be triggered if the JVM or the system libraries have bugs.\nFor example JITed (generated) code, native methods or system calls (graphics driver) can have problems leading to real crashes (it was quite common to get a crash when you used ZIP functions and they ran out of memory). In those cases the crash handler of the JVM kicks in and dumps the state. It could also generate a OS core file (Dr. Watson on Windows and core dump on *nix).\nOn Linux/Unix you can easyly make a JVM crash by sending it a Signal to the running process. Note: you should not use SIGSEGV for this, since Hotspot catches this signal and re-throws it as a NullPointerException in most places. So it is better to send a SIGBUS for example.\n', 'questionId': '65200', 'answerId': '74867'}
{'answer': u"From a design perspective, I think it is wrong to require a static implementation member...  The relative deference between performance and memory usage between static and not for the example string is minimal.  That aside, I understand that in implementation the object in question could have a significantly larger foot print...\nThe essential problem is that by trying to setup a model to support static implementation members that are avaialble at a base or interface level with C# is that our options are limited...  Only properties and methods are available at the interface level.\nThe next design challenge is whether the code will be base or implementation specific.  With implementation your model will get some valdiation at compile time at the code of having to include similar logic in all implementations.  With base your valdiation will occur at run time but logic would be centralized in one place.  Unfortunately, the given example is the perfect show case for implemntation specific code as there is no logic associated with the data.\nSo for sake of the example, lets assume there is some actual logic associated with the data and that it is extensive nad/or complex enough to provide a showcase for base classing.  Setting aside whether the base class logic uses any impelementation details or not, we have the problem of insuring implemtation static initialization.  I would recommend using an protected abstract in the base class to force all implementations to created the needed static data that would be valdated at compile time.  All IDE's I work with make this very quick any easy.  For Visual Studio it only takes a few mouse clicks and then just changing the return value essentially.\nCircling back to the very specific nature of the question and ignoring many of the other design problems...  If you really must keep this entire to the nature of static data and still enforce it thru the nature confines of the problem...  Definately go with a method over properties, as there are way to many side effects to make go use of properties.  Use a static member on the base class and use a static constructor on the implementations to set the name.  Now keep in mind that you have to valdiate the name at run-time and not compile time.  Basically the GetName method on the base class needs to handle what happens when an implementation does not set it's name.  It could throw an exception making it brutally apparent that something is worng with an implementation that was hopefulyl cause by testing/QA and not a user.  Or you could use reflection to get the implementation name and try to generate a name...  The problem with reflection is that it could effect sub classes and set up a code situation that would be difficult for a junior level developer to understand and maintain...\nFor that matter you could always generate the name from the class name thru reflection...  Though in the long term this could be a nightmare to maintain...  It would however reduce the amount of code needed on the implementations, which seems more important than any other concerns.  Your could also use attributes here as well, but then you are adding code into the implementations that is equivalent in time/effort as a static constructor and still have the problem off what todo when the implementation does not include that information.\n", 'questionId': '66505', 'answerId': '74982'}

When a\n  technical error must cause business\n  processing to fail, it should be\n  wrapped as a SystemError. \nDomain errors should always start from a\n  domain problem and be handled by\n  domain code. \nDomain errors should\n  pass "seamlessly" through technical\n  boundaries. It may be that such errors\n  must be serialized and re-constituted\n  for this to happen. Proxies and\n  facades should take responsibility for\n  doing this. \nTechnical errors should\n  be handled in particular points in the\n  application, such as boundaries (see\n  Log at Distribution Boundary). \nThe\n  amount of context information passed\n  back with the error will depend on how\n  useful this will be for subsequent\n  diagnosis and handling (figuring out\n  an alternative strategy). You need to\n  question whether the stack trace from\n  a remote machine is wholly useful to\n  the processing of a domain error\n  (although the code location of the\n  error and variable values at that time\n  may be useful)\n\nSo, wrap the hibernate exception at the boundary to hibernate with an unchecked domain exception such as a "UniqueUsernameException", and let that bubble up all the way to the handler of it.

{'answer': u"There's a fundamental difference in how the languages define an object's life time. In Java and .Net the object members are zero/null initialized before any constructor is run and is at this point that the object life time begins. So when you enter the constructor you've already got an initialized object.\nIn C++ the object life time only begins when the constructor finishes (although member variables and base classes are fully constructed before it starts). This explains the behaviour when virtual functions are called and also why the destructor isn't run if there's an exception in the constructor's body.\nThe problem with the Java/.Net definition of object lifetime is that it's harder to make sure the object always meets its invariant without having to put in special cases for when the object is initialized but the constructor hasn't run. The problem with the C++ definition is that you have this odd period where the object is in limbo and not fully constructed.\n", 'questionId': '36832', 'answerId': '75654'}

{'answer': u"I have found the C++ behavior very annoying. You cannot write virtual functions to, for instance, return the desired size of the object, and have the default constructor initialize each item. For instance it would be nice to do:\nBaseClass() {\n   for (int i=0; i<virtualSize(); i++)\n     initialize_stuff_for_index(i);\n}\nThen again the advantage of C++ behavior is that it discourages constuctors like the above from being written.\nI don't think the problem of calling methods that assume the constructor has been finished is a good excuse for C++. If this really was a problem then the constructor would not be allowed to call any methods, since the same problem can apply to methods for the base class.\nAnother point against C++ is that the behavior is much less efficient. Although the constructor knows directly what it calls, the vtab pointer has to be changed for every single class from base to final, because the constructor might call other methods that will call virtual functions. From my experience this wastes far more time than is saved by making virtual functions calls in the constructor more efficient.\nFar more annoying is that this is also true of destructors. If you write a virtual cleanup() function, and the base class destructor does cleanup(), it certainly does not do what you expect.\nThis and the fact that C++ calls destructors on static objects on exit have really pissed me off for a long time.\n", 'questionId': '36832', 'answerId': '77445'}

{'answer': u'For static analysis tools I often use CPD, PMD, FindBugs, and Checkstyle.\nCPD is the PMD "Copy/Paste Detector" tool. I was using PMD for a little while before I noticed the "Finding Duplicated Code" link on the PMD web page.\nI\'d like to point out that these tools can sometimes be extended beyond their "out-of-the-box" set of rules. And not just because they\'re open source so that you can rewrite them. Some of these tools come with applications or "hooks" that allow them to be extended. For example, PMD comes with the "designer" tool that allows you to create new rules. Also, Checkstyle has the DescendantToken check that has properties that allow for substantial customization.\nI integrate these tools with an Ant-based build. You can follow the link to see my commented configuration.\nIn addition to the simple integration into the build, I find it helpful to configure the tools to be somewhat "integrated" in a couple of other ways. Namely, report generation and warning suppression uniformity. I\'d like to add these aspects to this discussion (which should probably have the "static-analysis" tag also): how are folks configuring these tools to create a "unified" solution? (I\'ve asked this question separately here)\nFirst, for warning reports, I transform the output so that each warning has the simple format:\n\nThis is often called the "Emacs format," but even if you aren\'t using Emacs, it\'s a reasonable format for homogenizing reports. For example:\n\nMy warning format transformations are done by my Ant script with Ant filterchains.\nThe second "integration" that I do is for warning suppression. By default, each tool supports comments or an annotation (or both) that you can place in your code to silence a warning that you want to ignore. But these various warning suppression requests do not have a consistent look which seems somewhat silly. When you\'re suppressing a warning, you\'re suppressing a warning, so why not always write "SuppressWarning?"\nFor example, PMD\'s default configuration suppresses warning generation on lines of code with the string "NOPMD" in a comment. Also, PMD supports Java\'s @SuppressWarnings annotation. I configure PMD to use comments containing "SuppressWarning(PMD." instead of NOPMD so that PMD suppressions look alike. I fill in the particular rule that is violated when using the comment style suppression:\n\nOnly the "SuppressWarnings(PMD." part is significant for a comment, but it is consistent with PMD\'s support for the @SuppressWarning annotation which does recognize individual rule violations by name:\n\nSimilarly, Checkstyle suppresses warning generation between pairs of comments (no annotation support is provided). By default, comments to turn Checkstyle off and on contain the strings CHECKSTYLE:OFF and CHECKSTYLE:ON, respectively. Changing this configuration (with Checkstyle\'s "SuppressionCommentFilter") to use the strings "BEGIN\xa0SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle." and "END\xa0SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle." makes the controls look more like PMD:\n\nWith Checkstyle comments, the particular check violation (HiddenField) is significant because each check has its own "BEGIN/END" comment pair.\nFindBugs also supports warning generation suppression with a @SuppressWarnings annotation, so no further configuration is required to achieve some level of uniformity with other tools. Unfortunately, Findbugs has to support a custom @SuppressWarnings annotation because the built-in Java @SuppressWarnings annotation has a SOURCE retention policy which is not strong enough to retain the annotation in the class file where FindBugs needs it. I fully qualify FindBugs warnings suppressions to avoid clashing with Java\'s @SuppressWarnings annotation:\n\nThese techniques makes things look reasonably consistent across tools. Note that having each warning suppression contain the string "SuppressWarnings" makes it easy to run a simple search to find all instances for all tools over an entire code base.\n', 'questionId': '4080', 'answerId': '79845'}

{'answer': u'WS-Security specifications are not typically contained in a WSDL (never in a WSE WSDL). So wsdl2java does not know that WS-Security is even required for this service. The fact that security constraints are not present in a WSE WSDL is a big disappointment to me (WCF will include WS-Trust information in a WSDL).\nOn the client end, you\'ll need to use Rampart to add the necessary WS-Security headers to your outgoing client message.

{'answer': u"There is an example on Laurent Schneider's blog of using the DBMS_XA package inside Oracle to permit multiple sessions to work in the same transaction.  So it would be possible to have Java and C++ sessions participating in the same transaction without needing any sort of additional coordinator.  \nAlternately, you might consider using Workspace Manager.  That was originally designed to support extremely long-running transactions (i.e. manipulating lots of spatial data for a proposed development).  Essentially, you can create a workspace, which in your case would be roughly equivalent to a named transaction.  Both the Java and C++ code could enter that workspace (from separate sessions) and both could manipulate and commit data in that workspace.  When the transaction was complete, you could then merge the workspace to the LIVE workspace, which is equivalent to doing a commit in a normal transaction.\nOn the other hand, I would strongly agree with your initial assessment that coordinating transactions between processes is very likely to be a bad idea from a performance, stability, simplicity, and maintenance standpoint.  On the other hand, it may well be a legitimate business requirement depending on how the C++ code is going to be retired (i.e. whether it is possible to replace code in such a way that transactions can be either exclusively Java or exclusively C++)\n", 'questionId': '44005', 'answerId': '87500'}

{'answer': u'On any large enough system, with many layers, checked exception are useless as, anyway, you need an architectural level strategy to handle how the exception will be handled (use a fault barrier)\nWith checked exceptions your error handling stategy is micro-managed and its unbearable on any large system.\nMost of the time you don\'t know if an error is "recoverable" because you don\'t know in what layer the caller of your API is located.\nLet\'s say that I create a StringToInt API that converts the string representation of an integer to an Int. Must I throw a checked exception if the API is called with the "foo" string ? Is it recoverable ? I don\'t know because in his layer the caller of my StringToInt API may already have validated the input, and if this exception is thrown it\'s either a bug or a data corruption and it isn\'t recoverable for this layer.\nIn this case the caller of the API does not want to catch the exception. He only wants to let the exception "bubble up". If I chose a checked exception, this caller will have plenty of useless catch block only to artificially rethrow the exception.\nWhat is recoverable depends most of the time on the caller of the API, not on the writter of the API. An API should not use checked exceptions as only unchecked exceptions allows to choose to either catch or ignore an exception.\n', 'questionId': '27578', 'answerId': '87779'}

{'answer': u'I\'m fairly surprised at how unanimous the sentiment is that getters and setters are fine and good. I suggest the incendiary article by Allen Holub "Getters And Setters Are Evil". Granted, the title is for shock value, but the author makes valid points.\nEssentially, if you have getters and setters for each and every private field, you are making those fields as good as public. You\'d be very hard-pressed to change the type of a private field without ripple effects to every class that calls that getter.\nMoreover, from a strictly OO point of view, objects should be responding to messages (methods) that correspond to their (hopefully) single responsibility. The vast majority of getters and setters don\'t make sense for their constituent objects;Pen.dispenseInkOnto(Surface) makes more sense to me than Pen.getColor().\nGetters and setters also encourage users of the class to ask the object for some data, perform a calculation, and then set some other value in the object, better known as procedural programming. You\'d be better served to simply tell the object to do what you were going to in the first place; also known as the Information Expert idiom.\nGetters and setters, however, are necessary evils at the boundary of layers -- UI, persistence, and so forth. Restricted access to a class\'s internals, such as C++\'s friend keyword, Java\'s package protected access, .NET\'s internal access, and the Friend Class Pattern can help you reduce the visibility of getters and setters to only those who need them.\n', 'questionId': '126', 'answerId': '98244'}

{'answer': u'Process Large XML Files with XQuery Works with Gigabyte Size XML Files\nhttp://www.xquery.com\nXQuery is a query language that was designed as a native XML query language. Because most types of data can be represented as XML, XQuery can also be used to query other types of data. For example, XQuery can be used to query relational data using an XML view of a relational database. This is important because many Internet applications need to integrate information from multiple sources, including data found in web messages, relational data, and various XML sources. XQuery was specifically designed for this kind of data integration.\nFor example, suppose your company is a financial institution that needs to produce reports of stock holdings for each client. A client requests a report with a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) message, which is represented in XML. In most businesses, the stock holdings data is stored in multiple relational databases, such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, or DB2. XQuery can query both the SOAP message and the relational databases, creating a report in XML.\nXQuery is based on the structure of XML and leverages that structure to make it possible to perform queries on any type of data that can be represented as XML, including relational data. In addition, XQuery API for Java (XQJ) lets your queries run in any environment that supports the J2EE platform.\n', 'questionId': '62423', 'answerId': '114810'}

Hibernate sees that the item was already in the cache, and Hibernate does not replace (probably not to break my earlier reference nastyItem) it with the newly loaded value, but uses MY nastyItem I have put into the Session cache myself. Even worse, now the lazy loading of the buyer is broken: it contains null.\n\nTo avoid these Session issues, I always do a flush and a clear after a save, merge, update or delete.

{'answer': u'Thomas\' answer will only work if you know which "whois" server to connect to.\nThere are many different ways of finding that out, but none (AFAIK) that works uniformly for every domain registry.\nSome domain names support an SRV record for the _nicname._tcp service in the DNS, but there are issues with that because there\'s no accepted standard yet on how to prevent a subdomain from serving up SRV records which override those of the official registry (see http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sanz-whois-srv-00).\nFor many TLDs it\'s possible to send your query to <tld>.whois-servers.net.  This actually works quite well, but beware that it won\'t work in all cases where there are officially delegated second level domains.\nFor example in .uk there are several official sub-domains, but only some of them are run by the .uk registry and the others have their own WHOIS services and those aren\'t in the whois-servers.net database.\nConfusingly there are also "unofficial" registries, such as .uk.com, which are in the whois-servers.net database.\np.s. the official End-Of-Line delimiter in WHOIS, as with most IETF protocols is CRLF, not just LF.\n', 'questionId': '53623', 'answerId': '177758'}

{'answer': u'Actually reference counting and the strategies used by the Sun JVM are all different types of garbage collection algorithms.\nThere are two broad approaches for tracking down dead objects: tracing and reference counting. In tracing the GC starts from the "roots" - things like stack references, and traces all reachable (live) objects. Anything that can\'t be reached is considered dead. In reference counting each time a reference is modified the object\'s involved have their count updated. Any object whose reference count gets set to zero is considered dead.\nWith basically all GC implementations there are trade offs but tracing is usually good for high through put (i.e. fast) operation but has longer pause times (larger gaps where the UI or program may freeze up). Reference counting can operate in smaller chunks but will be slower overall. It may mean less freezes but poorer performance overall.\nAdditionally a reference counting GC requires a cycle detector to clean up any objects in a cycle that won\'t be caught by their reference count alone. Perl 5 didn\'t have a cycle detector in its GC implementation and could leak memory that was cyclic.\nResearch has also been done to get the best of both worlds (low pause times, high throughput):\nhttp://cs.anu.edu.au/~Steve.Blackburn/pubs/papers/urc-oopsla-2003.pdf\n', 'questionId': '21934', 'answerId': '196487'}

{'answer': u'@erickson.\nStrings are immutable types. You cannot modify them, only return new string instances.\nBecause of that, "foo".format() makes little sense, as it would have to be called like\n\nThe original java authors (and .NET authors), decided that a static method made more sense in this situation, as you are not modifying "foo", but instead calling a format method and passing in an input string.\nEDIT: Heh, this site can be so amusing sometimes. I got downvoted for mentioning the fact that strings are immutable types.\nHere is an example of why Format() would be dumb as an instance method. In .NET (and probably in Java), Replace() is an instance method.\nYou can do this:\n\nHowever, nothing happens, because Strings are immutable. Replace tries to return a new string, but it is assigned to nothing.\nThis causes lots of common rookie mistakes like:\n\nAgain, nothing happens, instead you have to do :\n\nNow, if you understand that strings are immutable, that makes perfect sense. If you don\'t, then you are just confused. The proper place for Replace, would be where Format is, as a static method of String:\n\nNow there is no question as to whats going on.\nThe real question is, why did the authors of these frameworks decide that one should be an instance method, and the other static? In my opinion, both are more elegantly expressed as static methods, but erickson seems to think both belong as instance methods.\nRegardless of your opinion, the truth is that you are less prone to make a mistake using the static version, and the code is easier to understand (No Hidden Gotchas).\nOf course there are some methods that are perfect as instance methods, take String.Length()\n\nIn this situation, its obvious we are not trying to modify "123", we just inspecting it, and returning its length...This is a perfect candidate for an instance method.\nMy simple rules for Instance Methods on Immutable Objects:\n\nIf you need to return a new instance of the same type, use a static method.\nOtherwise, use an instance method.\n\n', 'questionId': '47045', 'answerId': '198356'}

{'answer': u"Don't do what the developers at my company did. Somebody created an [sic] InvalidArguementException that parallels java.lang.IllegalArgumentException, and we now use it in (literally) hundreds of classes. Both indicate that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument. Talk about a waste...\nJoshua Bloch covers this in Effective Java Programming Language Guide [my bible of first resort on Best Practices] Chapter 8. Exceptions Item 42: Favor the use of standard exceptions. Here's a bit of what he says,\n\nReusing preexisting exceptions has several benefits. Chief among these, it makes your API easier to learn and use because it matches established conventions with which programmers are already familiar [my emphasis, not Bloch's]. A close second is that programs using your API are easier to read because they aren't cluttered with unfamiliar exceptions. Finally, fewer exception classes mean a smaller memory footprint and less time spent loading classes.\nThe most commonly reused exception is IllegalArgumentException. This is generally the exception to throw when the caller passes in an argument whose value is inappropriate. For example, this would be the exception to throw if the caller passed a negative number in a parameter representing the number of times some action were to be repeated.\n\nThat said, you should never throw Exception itself. Java has a well-chosen, diverse and well-targeted bunch of built-in exceptions that cover most situations AND describe the exception that occurred well enough so that you can remedy the cause.\nBe friendly to the programmers who have to maintain your code in the future.\n", 'questionId': '26984', 'answerId': '216589'}

{'answer': u'Putting to one side questions of protecting against physical tampering (e.g. of the underlying database), since you\'ve stipulated that physical security is not the present concern...\nI think the primary consideration is how to ensure that a given voter votes only once. At a paper poll, each registered voter is restricted to a particular booth/location and verification is done by name+SSN and a signature.\nYou might need a high resolution digital signature capture and therefore a touchscreen capture peripheral or a touch screen terminal.  A more sophisticated approach would be a biometric scanner, but that would require government records of thumb/finger prints or retinal scan - I can already see the privacy advocates lining up at the lawyer\'s offices.\nAnother approach would be for the voter "registrar office" to issue digital keys to each voter prior to the election - a (relatively) short (cryptographically strong) random alpha/numeric key that is entered with the voter\'s name and/or SSN into the application. Knowledge of that key is required for that particular voter in that particular election.  These keys would be issued by post in tamper-evident envelopes, like those used by banks for postal confirmation of wire transfers and delivery of PIN numbers.  The key must include checksum data so that the user can have the entry of it immediately validated and it should be in groups of 4, so something like XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-CCCC.\nAny other "secret" knowledge, such as SSN, is likely too easily discovered for a large percentage of the population (though we don\'t seem to be able to make credit-granting organizations understand this), and therefore is unsuitable for authentication.\nVote counting can be done by generating a public key encrypted data file which is transferred (by sneaker net?) to the central system.  This must include the "voting booth" identity information and a record for each voter including their SSN and the digital key (or signature, or biometric data).  Votes with invalid keys are eliminated.  Multiple votes with the same key and same votes are treated as a single vote for that candidate.  Multiple votes with the same key and different votes are flagged for fraud investigation (with the constituent contacted by phone, issued a new key, and directed to revote).\n', 'questionId': '29357', 'answerId': '255594'}
{'answer': u'To answer you question most directly, precise semantics on how threads are implemented are deliberately left undefined by the JVM specification.\nFWIW, Sebastion\'s statement that "Java\'s exposed threading model is the same on every platform and defined in the Java specifications. To a Java application, the underlying OS should be completely transparent even for threading", is inaccurate.\nI have found significant empirical differences between threading under Windows and Linux regarding thread starvation using wait/notify.  Linux is significantly more prone to starvation when the many threads contend for a single lock - to the extent that I had to load up 3 orders of magnitude more threads in Windows to cause starvation than in Linux.  For heavily contended locks the Java concurrency locks with a fair modifier become critical.\nTo illustrate numbers, I had problems under Linux with one lock heavily contended by 31 threads, where the same code under Windows required 10,000 (yes, that\'s 10 thousand) threads to begin to demonstrate starvation problems.\nTo make matters worse, there have been 3 different threading models under Linux, each of which have different characteristics.\nMostly, threading has been transparent in my experience, but issues of contention deserve careful consideration.\n', 'questionId': '67183', 'answerId': '255653'}

{'answer': u'There are some issues worth noticing if you\'re dealing with classes that are persisted using an Object-Relationship Mapper (ORM) like Hibernate, if you didn\'t think this was unreasonably complicated already!\nLazy loaded objects are subclasses\nIf your objects are persisted using an ORM, in many cases you will be dealing with dynamic proxies to avoid loading object too early from the data store. These proxies are implemented as subclasses of your own class. This means thatthis.getClass() == o.getClass() will return false. For example:\n\nIf you\'re dealing with an ORM, using o instanceof Person is the only thing that will behave correctly.\nLazy loaded objects have null-fields\nORMs usually use the getters to force loading of lazy loaded objects. This means that person.name will be null if person is lazy loaded, even if person.getName() forces loading and returns "John Doe". In my experience, this crops up more often in hashCode() and equals().\nIf you\'re dealing with an ORM, make sure to always use getters, and never field references in hashCode() and equals().\nSaving an object will change its state\nPersistent objects often use a id field to hold the key of the object. This field will be automatically updated when an object is first saved. Don\'t use an id field in hashCode(). But you can use it in equals().\nA pattern I often use is\n\nBut: you cannot include getId() in hashCode(). If you do, when an object is persisted, its hashCode changes. If the object is in a HashSet, you\'ll "never" find it again.\nIn my Person example, I probably would use getName() for hashCode and getId() plus getName() (just for paranoia) for equals(). It\'s okay if there are some risk of "collisions" for hashCode(), but never okay for equals().\nhashCode() should use the non-changing subset of properties from equals()\n', 'questionId': '27581', 'answerId': '256447'}

{'answer': u'Abeille is very good and is based on the JGoodies FormLayout. Unlike almost every other Java GUI builder, Abeille does not generate code by default. In the project I used it on, it was wonderful to avoid reading or scrolling through the layout code (because that code no longer existed). Most of our hand-written code concerned itself with connecting events to actions, simply asking the layout for the relevant controls.\nIt\'s a crime that code generation is the default way to layout code in Java because better ways of doing GUIs have been around for decades. I have used Matisse, the NetBeans GUI code generator. While Matisse (now known as "Swing GUI Builder") makes it pleasant to layout components, it is similar to all other code generation tools because when you use Matisse you must live in constant fear that someone else edited the "you cannot edit this in NetBeans" GUI sections outside of NetBeans. As soon as you touch the layout builder again it could destroy their work and then you have a broken GUI. There might be some simple task like re-ordering a variable initialization and its use or re-naming a variable (this was especially a problem when using Matisse\'s database feature). You know how to do this by editing the un-editable source code but may waste time trying to figure out how to do the same thing in the GUI builder.

However, the best place to lock down the socket factories is in the constructor of the remote object.  \n\nSo, the first argument specifies the part on which the object is expecting requests, whereas the second and third specify the socket factories that will be used at either end of the connection driving this remote object.\nSince we wanted to restrict the ports used by the connection, we needed to extend the RMI socket factories and lock down the ports.  Here are some sketches of our server and client factories:\n\nNote that the server socket factory above ensures that only the port that you previously specified will ever be used by this factory.  The client socket factory has to be paired with the appropriate socket factory (or you'll never connect).\n\nSo, the only thing remaining to force your two way connection to stay on the same set of ports is some logic to recognize that you are calling back to the client-side.  In that situation, just make sure that your factory method for the remote object calls the RemoteObjectWrapper constructor up top with the callback parameter set to true.\n", 'questionId': '56687', 'answerId': '303081'}

{'answer': u"It's not just a matter of the ability to recover from the exception. What matter most, in my opinion, is whether the caller is interested in catching the exception or not.\nIf you write a library to be used elsewhere, or a lower-level layer in your application, ask yourself if the caller is interested in catching (knowing about) your exception. If he is not, then use an unchecked exception, so you don't burden him unnecessarily.\nThis is the philosophy used by many frameworks. Spring and hibernate, in particularly, come to mind - they convert known checked exception to unchecked exception precisely because checked exceptions are overused in Java. One example that I can think of is the JSONException from json.org, which is a checked exception and is mostly annoying - it should be unchecked, but the developer simply haven't thought it through.\nBy the way, most of the time the caller's interest in the exception is directly correlated to the ability to recover from the exception, but that is not always the case.\n", 'questionId': '27578', 'answerId': '322801'}
{'answer': u'You\'re correct. \nUnchecked exceptions are used to let the system fail fast which is a good thing. You should clearly state what is your method expecting in order to work properly.  This way you can validate the input only once.\nFor instance:\n\nJust to put an example. The point is, if the system fails fast, then you\'ll know where and why it did fail.  You\'ll get an stacktrace like:\n\nAnd you\'ll know what happened. The OtherClass in the "delegateTheWork" method ( at line 4569 ) called your class with the "exit" value, even when it shouldn\'t  etc.\nOtherwise you would have to sprinkle validations all over your code and that\'s error prone. Plus, sometimes it is hard to track what went wrong and you may expect hours of frustrating  debugging \nSame thing happens with NullPointerExceptions. If you have a 700 lines class with some 15 methods, that uses 30 attributes and none of them can be null, instead of validating in each of those methods for nullability you could make all those attributes read-only and validate them in the constructor or factory method.\n\nChecked exceptions Are useful when the programmer ( you or your co-workers ) did everything right, validated the input, ran tests, and all the code is perfect, but the code connects to a third party webservice that may be down ( or a file you were using  was deleted by another external process etc ) . The webservice may even be validate before the connection is attempted, but during the data transfer something went wrong.\nIn that scenario there is nothing that you or your co-workers can do to help it. But still you have to do something and not let the application just die and disappear in the eyes of the user.  You use a checked exception for that and handle the exception, what can you do when that happens?, most of the time , just to attempt to log the error, probably save your work ( the app work ) and present a message to the user. ( The site blabla is down, please retry later etc. ) \nIf the checked exception are overused ( by  adding the "throw Exception" in the all the methods signatures ) , then your code will become very fragile, because everyone will ignore that exception ( because is too general ) and the quality of code will be seriously compromised.\nIf you overuse unchecked exception something similar will happen. The users of that code don\'t know if something may go wrong an a lot of try{...}catch( Throwable t ) will appear.\n', 'questionId': '27578', 'answerId': '322889'}

Ditto for, as noted by others, jsp tags, spring configuration, eclipse tools, etc. etc... \nFighting against what your tools expect to see is a recipe for long sessions trolling through google trying to find that non-standard way of initiating spring beans. Really not worth the trouble.\nOnce you have your elegantly coded application with hundreds of public variables you will likely find at least one situation where they're insufficient- where you absolutely need immutability, or you need to trigger some event when the variable gets set, or you want to throw an exception on a variable change because it sets an object state to something unpleasant. You're then stuck with the unenviable choices between  cluttering up your code with some special method everywhere the variable is directly referenced, having some special access form for 3 out of the 1000 variables in your application. \n\nAnd this is in the best case scenario of working entirely in a self-contained private project.

{'answer': u"I have a similar task and I am also considering different frameworks.

The same story with NetBeans: somehow somewhere somewhat reads out xml config files and creates UI from that, cool, as long as you follow the tutorial. And of course you can't develop and Eclipse-based RCP using some other IDE, NB is also very jealous about its usage (unless you do some hacks like I did).\nWhat I'm lacking is a clear way to debug my threads from main to action performed.

Sun maintains a good reputation on their backward compatibility, although sometimes this seems too rigid and slows the pace.\nTools. Java has good cross-platform IDEs. Netbeans, Eclipse, etc. Most of them are free. VS Studio is good but only on Windows, and not cost a bit. Both of them provides good unit tests, debugs, profiles, etc.\n\nHence I'd suggest that Java is a better choice. As a show case, there are some famous desktop cross-platforms apps developed by Java: Vuze, Limewire, BlogBridge, CrossFTP, not to mention those IDEs. As to .Net, I have limited knowledge on such success apps.\n", 'questionId': '61559', 'answerId': '448793'}

{'answer': u'Edit: This was written before Oracle bought Sun and started a rampage to kill everything that does not make them a billion $ per day. See the comments for an OSS Fork. I still stand by my opinion that stuff like that (MMO Middleware) is realistic, you just need a company that doesn\'t suck behind it.\nThe Market may be dominated by few large games, but that does not mean that there is not a lot of room for more niche games. Lets face it: If you want to reach 100.000+ players, you\'re ending up building your own technology stack, at least for the critical core. That\'s what CCP did for EVE Online (StacklessIO), that\'s what Blizzard did for World of Warcraft (although they do use many third-party libraries), that\'s what Mythic did for Warhammer Online (although they are based on Gamebryo).\nHowever, if you aim to be a small, niche MMO (like the dozens of Free-to-Play/Itemshop MMOs), then getting the Network stuff right is just insanely hard, data consistency is even harder and scalability is the biggest b*tch.\nBut game technology is not your only problem - you also need to tackle Billing. Credit Card only? Have fun selling in Germany then, people there want ELV. That\'s where you need a reliable billing provider, but you still need to wire in the billing application with your accounts to make sure that accounts are blocked/reactivated when the billing fails.\nThere are some companies already offering "MMO Infratructure Services" (i.e. Arvato\'s EEIS), but the bottom line is: Stuff like Project Darkstar IS realistic, but assuming that you can build a Multi-Billion-MMO entirely on a Third Party Stack is optimistic, possibly idealistic.\nBut then again, entirely inventing all of the technology is even more stupid - use the Third Party stuff that you need (i.e. Billing, Font Rendering, Audio Output...), but write the stuff that really makes or breaks your business (i.e. Network stack, User interface etc.) on your own. (Note: Jeff\'s posting may be a bit flawed, but the overall direction is correct IMHO.)\nAddendum: Also, the game industry does license and reuse engines a lot. The most prominent game Engines are the Unreal Engine, Source Engine and id Tech, which fuel dozens, if not hundreds of games. But there are some lesser-known (outside of the industry) engines. There is Gamebryo, the Middleware behind games like Civilization 4 and Fallout 3, there was RenderWare that is now only EA-in-House, but used in games like Battlefield 2 or The Sims 3. There is the open source Ogre3d, which was used in some commercial titles. If you\'re just looking for Sound, there\'s stuff like FMOD or if you want to do font-rendering, why not give FreeType a spin?\nWhat I\'m saying is: Third-Party Engines/Middleware do exist, and they ARE being successfully used since more than a decade (I know for sure that id\'s Wolfenstein Engine was licensed to other companies, and that was 1992), even by big companies in multi-million-dollar titles. The important thing is the support, because a good engine with no help in case of an issue is pretty much worthless or at least very expensive if the developer has to spend their game-development-time with unneccessary debugging of the Engine.\nIf the Darkstar folks manage to get the support side right and 2 or 3 higher profile titles out, I do believe it could succeed in opening the MMO market to a lot more smaller developers and indies.\n', 'questionId': '20034', 'answerId': '485304'}

{'answer': u"The best solution to mocking is to have the machine do all the work with automated specification-based testing. For Java, see ScalaCheck and the Reductio framework included in the Functional Java library. With automated specification-based testing frameworks, you supply a specification of the method under test (a property about it that should be true) and the framework generates tests as well as mock objects, automatically.\nFor example, the following property tests the Math.sqrt method to see if the square root of any positive number n squared is equal to n.\n\nWhen you call propSqrt.check(), ScalaCheck generates hundreds of integers and checks your property for each, also automatically making sure that the edge cases are covered well.\nEven though ScalaCheck is written in Scala, and requires the Scala Compiler, it's easy to test Java code with it.

{'answer': u"Basically, AFAIK, C++ templates create a copy of the code for each type, while Java generics use exactly the same code.\nYes, you can say that C++ template is equivalent to Java generic concept ( although more properly would be to say Java generics are equivalent to C++ in concept ) \n\nIf you are familiar with C++'s template mechanism, you might think that generics are similar, but the similarity is superficial. Generics do not generate a new class for each specialization, nor do they permit \u201ctemplate metaprogramming.\u201d\n\nfrom: Java Generics\n", 'questionId': '36347', 'answerId': '498321'}
{'answer': u"Java Generics are massively different to C++ templates.\nBasically in C++ templates are basically a glorified preprocessor/macro set (Note: since some people seem unable to comprehend an analogy, I'm not saying template processing is a macro).  In Java they are basically syntactic sugar to minimize boilerplate casting of Objects.  Here is a pretty decent introduction to C++ templates vs Java generics.\nTo elaborate on this point: when you use a C++ template, you're basically creating another copy of the code, just as if you used a #define macro.  This allows you to do things like have int parameters in template definitions that determine sizes of arrays and such.\nJava doesn't work like that.  In Java all objects extent from java.lang.Object so, pre-Generics, you'd write code like this:\n\nbecause all the Java collection types used Object as their base type so you could put anything in them.  Java 5 rolls around and adds generics so you can do things like:\n\nAnd that's all Java Generics are: wrappers for casting objects.  That's because Java Generics aren't refined.  They use type erasure.  This decision was made because Java Generics came along so late in the piece that they didn't want to break backward compatibility (a Map<String, String> is usable whenever a Map is called for).  Compare this to .Net/C# where type erasure isn't used, which leads to all sorts of differences (e.g. you can use primitive types and IEnumerable and IEnumerable<T> bear no relation to each other).\nAnd a class using generics compiled with a Java 5+ compiler is usable on JDK 1.4 (assuming it doesn't use any other features or classes that require Java 5+).\nThat's why Java Generics are called syntactic sugar.\nBut this decision on how to do generics has profound effects so much so that the (superb) Java Generics FAQ has sprung up to answer the many, many questions people have about Java Generics.\nC++ templates have a number of features that Java Generics don't:\n\nUse of primitive type arguments.\nFor example:\n\nJava does not allow the use of primitive type arguments in generics.\nUse of default type arguments, which is one feature I miss in Java but there are backwards compatibility reasons for this;\nJava allows bounding of arguments.\n\nFor example:\n\nIt really does need to be stressed that template invocations with different arguments really are different types.  They don't even share static members.  In Java this is not the case.\nAside from the differences with generics, for completeness, here is a basic comparison of C++ and Java (and another one).\nAnd I can also suggest Thinking in Java.  As a C++ programmer a lot of the concepts like objects will be second nature already but there are subtle differences so it can be worthwhile to have an introductory text even if you skim parts.\nA lot of what you'll learn when learning Java is all the libraries (both standard--what comes in the JDK--and nonstandard, which includes commonly used things like Spring).  Java syntax is more verbose than C++ syntax and doesn't have a lot of C++ features (e.g. operator overloading, multiple inheritance, the destructor mechanism, etc) but that doesn't strictly make it a subset of C++ either.\n", 'questionId': '36347', 'answerId': '498329'}

{'answer': u'Intersection types allow you to (kinda sorta) do enums that have an inheritance hierarchy. You can\'t inherit implementation, but you can delegate it to a helper class.\n\nThis is useful when you have a number of different enums that implement some sort of pattern. For instance, a number of pairs of enums that have a parent-child relationship.\n\nYou can write generic methods that say "Ok, given an enum value thats a parent of some other enum values, what percentage of all the possible child enums of the child type have this particular parent value as their parent?", and have it all typesafe and done without casting. (eg: that "Sea" is 33% of all possible vehicles, and "Green" 20% of all possible Pastels).\nThe code look like this. It\'s pretty nasty, but there are ways to make it better. Note in particuar that the "leaf" classes themselves are quite neat - the generic classes have declarations that are horribly ugly, but you only write them onece. Once the generic classes are there, then using them is easy.\n\n', 'questionId': '15496', 'answerId': '574522'}
{'answer': u'From my point of view, you should change your underline Hibernate cache to that one, which supports clustered mode. It could be a JBoss Cache or a Swarm Cache.

Especially in large, multi-project situations with many users, those users may tend to be familiar with only one or two of the projects in the repository. But the projects-as-branch-siblings tends to de-emphasize project individuality and focus on the entire set of projects as a single entity. That\'s a social issue though. We like our originally suggested arrangement for purely practical reasons\u2014it\'s easier to ask about (or modify, or migrate elsewhere) the entire history of a single project when there\'s a single repository path that holds the entire history\u2014past, present, tagged, and branched\u2014for that project and that project alone."\nFor my own, I tend to agree quite strongly with this and prefer the following layout:\n/\n   utils/\n      calc/\n         trunk/\n         tags/\n         branches/\n      calendar/\n         trunk/\n         tags/\n         branches/\n      \u2026\n   office/\n      spreadsheet/\n         trunk/\n         tags/\n         branches/\nThe reason are simply that its impractical to tag a complete project set when one would want to tag only a specific subset.\nLet\'s use an example: If project-1 depends on moduleA v1.1 and moduleB v2.3, I don\'t want newer moduleA v2.x to appear in the tags. In fact, when coming back some days/weeks/months later to this tagged release, I would be forced to open the bundle descriptor in the tagged version of project-1 to read the version of moduleA actually required.\nMoreover, if I have to make a specific backup of this release\'s sources onto a CD, I just want to export this tag without downloading hundreds of megabytes of unrelated stuff.\nIt was just my two cents.\n', 'questionId': '14397', 'answerId': '610268'}

Then rewrite it into a policy that rampart could understand.  (Some updated docs helped.)\nConfigure rampart with this policy.\nTake the keys that were provided in the .pfx file and convert them to a java key store.

{'answer': u'\nI\'ve been reading a lot lately about the next release of Java possibly supporting closures. I feel like I have a pretty firm grasp on what closures are, but I can\'t think of a solid example of how they would make an Object-Oriented language "better."\n\nWell, most people who use the term "closure" actually mean "function object", and in this sense, function objects make it possible to write simpler code in certain circumstances such as when you need custom comparators in a sort function.  \nFor example, in Python:\n\nThis sorts the list a in reverse order by passing the custom comparison functoin reversecmp.  The addition of the lambda operator makes things even more compact:\n\nJava does not have function objects, so it uses "functor classes" to simulate them.  In Java you do the equivalent operation by implementing a custom version of the Comparator class, and passing that to the sort function:\n\nAs you can see, it gives the same effect as closures, but is clumsier and more verbose.  However, the addition of anonymous inner classes obviates most of the pain:\n\nSo I would say that the combination of functor classes + anonymous inner classes in Java is sufficient to compensate for the lack of true function objects, making their addition unnecessary.\n', 'questionId': '50255', 'answerId': '716716'}
{'answer': u"As a Lisp programmer I would wish that the Java community understands the following difference: functions as objects vs. closures.\na) functions can be named or anonymous. But they can also be objects of themselves. This allows functions to be passed around as arguments, returned from functions or stored in data structures. This means that functions are first class objects in a programming language.\nAnonymous functions don't add much to the language, they just allow you to write functions in a shorter way.\nb) A closure is a function plus a binding environment. Closures can be passed downwards (as parameters) or returned upwards (as return values). This allows the function to refer to variables of its environment, even if the surrounding code is no longer active.\nIf you have a) in some language, then the question comes up what to do about b)? There are languages that have a), but not b). In the functional programming world a) (functions) and b (functions as closures) is nowadays the norm. Smalltalk had a) (blocks are anonymous functions) for a long time, but then some dialects of Smalltalk added support for b) (blocks as closures).\nYou can imagine that you get a slightly different programming model, if you add functions and closures to the language. \nFrom a pragmatic view, the anonymous function adds some short notation, where you pass or invoke functions. That can be a good thing.\nThe closure (function plus binding) allows you for example to create a function that has access to some variables (for example to a counter value). Now you can store that function in an object, access it and invoke it. The context for the function object is now not only the objects it has access to, but also the variables it has access to via bindings. This is also useful, but you can see that variable bindings vs. access to object variables now is an issue: when should be something a lexical variable (that can be accessed in a closure) and when should it be a variable of some object (a slot). When should something be a closure or an object? You can use both in the similar ways. A usual programming exercise for students learning Scheme (a Lisp dialect) is to write a simple object system using closures.\nThe result is a more complicated programming language and a more complicated runtime model. Too complicated?\n", 'questionId': '50255', 'answerId': '716763'}
{'answer': u'Closures in an imperative language (examples: JavaScript, C#, the forthcoming C++ refresh) are not the same as anonymous inner classes. They need to be able to capture modifiable references to local variables. Java\'s inner classes can only capture local final variables.\nAlmost any language feature can be criticised as non-essential:\n\nfor, while, do are all just syntactic sugar over goto/if.\nInner classes are syntactic sugar over classes with a field pointing to the outer class.\nGenerics are syntactic sugar over casts.\n\nExactly the same "non-essential" argument should have blocked the inclusion of all the above features.\n', 'questionId': '50255', 'answerId': '716783'}
{'answer': u'A few people have said, or implied, that closures are just syntactic sugar - doing what you could already do with anonymous inner classes and making it more convenient to pass parameters in.\nThey are syntactic sugar in the same sense that Java is syntactic sugar for assembler (that "assembler" could be bytecode, for sake of argument). In other words they raise they level of abstraction, and this is an important concept.\nClosures promote the concept of the function-as-object to a first class entity - one that increases the expressiveness of code, rather than cluttering it with even more boilerplate.\nAn example that\'s close to my heart has already been mentioned by Tom Hawtin - implementing the Execute Around idiom, which is just about the only way to get RAII into Java. I wrote a blog entry on exactly that subject a couple of years ago when I first heard closures might be coming.\nIronically, I think the very reason that closures would be good for Java (more expressiveness with less code) may be what rattles many Java advocates. Java has a mindset of "spell everything out the long way". That and the fact that closures are a nod towards a more functional way of doing things - which I also see as a Good Thing, but may water down the pure OO message that many in the Java community hold dear.\n', 'questionId': '50255', 'answerId': '716804'}

{'answer': u"I have used reflection to do this in the past, and in my opinion it was a big mistake.\nStrictly speaking, you should not be writing unit tests that directly test private methods. What you should be testing is the public contract that the class has with other objects; you should never directly test an object's internals. If another developer wants to make a small internal change to the class, which doesn't affect the classes public contract, he/she then has to modify your reflection based test to ensure that it works. If you do this repeatedly throughout a project, unit tests then stop being a useful measurement of code health, and start to become a hindrance to development, and an annoyance to the development team.\nWhat I recommend doing instead is using a code coverage tool such as Cobertura, to ensure that the unit tests you write provide decent coverage of the code in private methods.

{'answer': u'NOTE: This answer applies to Maven 2 only! The mentioned LATEST and RELEASE metaversions have been dropped in Maven 3 "for the sake of reproducible builds", over 6 years ago.\nIf you  always want to use the newest version, Maven has two keywords you can use as an alternative to version ranges. You should use these options with care as you are no longer in control of the plugins/dependencies you are using.\n\nWhen you depend on a plugin or a dependency, you can use the a version value of LATEST or RELEASE. LATEST refers to the latest released or snapshot version of a particular artifact, the most recently deployed artifact in a particular repository. RELEASE refers to the last non-snapshot release in the repository. In general, it is not a best practice to design software which depends on a non-specific version of an artifact. If you are developing software, you might want to use RELEASE or LATEST as a convenience so that you don\'t have to update version numbers when a new release of a third-party library is released. When you release software, you should always make sure that your project depends on specific versions to reduce the chances of your build or your project being affected by a software release not under your control. Use LATEST and RELEASE with caution, if at all.\n\nSee the POM Syntax section of the Maven book for more details. Or see this doc on Dependency Version Ranges, where: \n\nA square bracket ( [ & ] ) means "closed" (inclusive).\nA parenthesis ( ( & ) ) means "open" (exclusive).\n\nHere\'s an example illustrating the various options. In the Maven repository, com.foo:my-foo has the following metadata:\n\nIf a dependency on that artifact is required, you have the following options (other version ranges can be specified of course, just showing the relevant ones here):\nDeclare an exact version (will always resolve to 1.0.1):\n\nDeclare an explicit version (will always resolve to 1.0.1 unless a collision occurs, when Maven will select a matching version):\n\nDeclare a version range for all 1.x (will currently resolve to 1.1.1):\n\nDeclare an open-ended version range (will resolve to 2.0.0):\n\nDeclare the version as LATEST (will resolve to 2.0.0) (removed from maven 3.x)\n\nDeclare the version as RELEASE (will resolve to 1.1.1) (removed from maven 3.x):\n\nNote that by default your own deployments will update the "latest" entry in the Maven metadata, but to update the "release" entry, you need to activate the "release-profile" from the Maven super POM. You can do this with either "-Prelease-profile" or "-DperformRelease=true"\n\nIt\'s worth emphasising that any approach that allows Maven to pick the dependency versions (LATEST, RELEASE, and version ranges) can leave you open to build time issues, as later versions can have different behaviour (for example the dependency plugin has previously switched a default value from true to false, with confusing results).\nIt is therefore generally a good idea to define exact versions in releases. As Tim\'s answer points out, the maven-versions-plugin is a handy tool for updating dependency versions, particularly the versions:use-latest-versions and versions:use-latest-releases goals.\n', 'questionId': '30571', 'answerId': '1172371'}
{'answer': u'Now I know this topic is old, but reading the question and the OP supplied answer it seems the Maven Versions Plugin might have actually been a better answer to his question:\nIn particular the following goals could be of use:\n\nversions:use-latest-versions searches the pom for all versions\nwhich have been a newer version and\nreplaces them with the latest\nversion.\nversions:use-latest-releases searches the pom for all non-SNAPSHOT\nversions which have been a newer\nrelease and replaces them with the\nlatest release version.\nversions:update-properties updates properties defined in a\nproject so that they correspond to\nthe latest available version of\nspecific dependencies. This can be\nuseful if a suite of dependencies\nmust all be locked to one version.\n\nThe following other goals are also provided:\n\nversions:display-dependency-updates scans a project\'s dependencies and\nproduces a report of those\ndependencies which have newer\nversions available.\nversions:display-plugin-updates scans a project\'s plugins and\nproduces a report of those plugins\nwhich have newer versions available.\nversions:update-parent updates the parent section of a project so\nthat it references the newest\navailable version. For example, if\nyou use a corporate root POM, this\ngoal can be helpful if you need to\nensure you are using the latest\nversion of the corporate root POM.\nversions:update-child-modules updates the parent section of the\nchild modules of a project so the\nversion matches the version of the\ncurrent project. For example, if you\nhave an aggregator pom that is also\nthe parent for the projects that it\naggregates and the children and\nparent versions get out of sync, this\nmojo can help fix the versions of the\nchild modules. (Note you may need to\ninvoke Maven with the -N option in\norder to run this goal if your\nproject is broken so badly that it\ncannot build because of the version\nmis-match).\nversions:lock-snapshots searches the pom for all -SNAPSHOT\nversions and replaces them with the\ncurrent timestamp version of that\n-SNAPSHOT, e.g. -20090327.172306-4\nversions:unlock-snapshots searches the pom for all timestamp\nlocked snapshot versions and replaces\nthem with -SNAPSHOT.\nversions:resolve-ranges finds dependencies using version ranges and\nresolves the range to the specific\nversion being used.\nversions:use-releases searches the pom for all -SNAPSHOT versions\nwhich have been released and replaces\nthem with the corresponding release\nversion.\nversions:use-next-releases searches the pom for all non-SNAPSHOT\nversions which have been a newer\nrelease and replaces them with the\nnext release version.\nversions:use-next-versions searches the pom for all versions\nwhich have been a newer version and\nreplaces them with the next version.\nversions:commit removes the pom.xml.versionsBackup files.

{'answer': u'I wanted to share the one I encountered today. I found built-in Parameterized runner is quite crude in Junit4 as compare to TestNG (I know each framework has its strengths but still). The Junit4 annotation @parameters is restricted to one set of parameters. I encountered this problem while testing the valid and invalid behavior for functionality in same test class. So the first public, static annotated method that it finds will be used, but it may find them in any order. This causes us to write different classes unnecessarily.

{'answer': u'Servlet mapping is a common problem.  But if you have any fitlers in your web.xml those can be the culprit as well.  One thing to realize is filters always execute the code before the doFilter before any servlets starts executing.  (Technically filters execute code after the doFilter)  In our code we created filters that would return 404 under certain situations.  Sometimes removing some or all filters-mapping will help discover if it is related to filter-mappings.\n', 'questionId': '66767', 'answerId': '1261685'}
{'answer': u"It has already been mentioned that a final array can be used to pass a variable out of the anonymous inner classes.\nAnother, arguably better and less ugly approach though is to use AtomicReference (or AtomicBoolean/AtomicInteger/\u2026) class from java.util.concurrent.atomic package.\nOne of the benefits in doing so is that these classes also provide such methods as compareAndSet, which may be useful if you're creating several threads which can modify the same variable.\n\nAnother useful related pattern:\n\nIn this particular example we could have simply waited on message for it to become non-null, however null may often be a valid value and then you need to use a separate flag to finish the wait.\nwaitMessageHandler(\u2026) above is yet another useful pattern: it sets up a handler somewhere, then starts executing the Interruptible which may throw an exception, and then removes the handler in the finally block, like so:\n\nHere I assume that the messageHandler's (if it's not null) handleMessage(\u2026) method is called by another thread when a message is received. messageHandler must not be simply of MessageHandler type: that way you will synchronize on a changing variable, which is clearly a bug.\nOf course, it doesn't need to be InterruptedException, it could be something like IOException, or whatever makes sense in a particular piece of code.\n", 'questionId': '15496', 'answerId': '1276933'}

{'answer': u'You\'re going the wrong way: a subclass of an enum would have fewer entries.\nIn pseudocode, think:\n\nAny method that can accept an Animal should be able to accept a Mammal, but not the other way around.  Subclassing is for making something more specific, not more general.  That\'s why "object" is the root of the class hierarchy.  Likewise, if enums were inheritable, then a hypothetical root of the enum hierarchy would have every possible symbol.\nBut no, C#/Java don\'t allow sub-enums, AFAICT, though it would be really useful at times.  It\'s probably because they chose to implement Enums as ints (like C) instead of interned symbols (like Lisp).  (Above, what does (Animal)1 represent, and what does (Mammal)1 represent, and are they the same value?)\nYou could write your own enum-like class (with a different name) that provided this, though.

{'answer': u'We are doing Swing development since nearly 10 years.

Obfuscation very easily breaks user interfaces created with a GUI designer or requires much work to avoid obfuscating such classes.\nAnother often happening case is that, for example, a panel should only contain some components depending on some condition.

{'answer': u'Voted up Jason Cohen\'s argument because it was well presented. Let me dismember it step by step. ;-)\n\nThe NPE JavaDoc explicitly says, "other illegal uses of the null object". If it was just limited to situations where the runtime encounters a null when it shouldn\'t, all such cases could be defined far more succinctly.\nCan\'t help it if you assume the wrong thing, but assuming encapsulation is applied properly, you really shouldn\'t care or notice whether a null was dereferenced inappropriately vs. whether a method detected an inappropriate null and fired an exception off.\nI\'d choose NPE over IAE for multiple reasons\n\nIt is more specific about the nature of the illegal operation\nLogic that mistakenly allows nulls tends to be very different from logic that mistakenly allows illegal values. For example, if I\'m validating data entered by a user, if I get value that is unacceptable, the source of that error is with the end user of the application. If I get a null, that\'s programmer error.\nInvalid values can cause things like stack overflows, out of memory errors, parsing exceptions, etc. Indeed, most errors generally present, at some point, as an invalid value in some method call. For this reason I see IAE as actually the MOST GENERAL of all exceptions under RuntimeException.\n\nActually, other invalid arguments can result in all kinds of other exceptions. UnknownHostException, FileNotFoundException, a variety of syntax error exceptions, IndexOutOfBoundsException, authentication failures, etc., etc.\n\nIn general, I feel NPE is much maligned because traditionally has been associated with code that fails to follow the fail fast principle. That, plus the JDK\'s failure to populate NPE\'s with a message string really has created a strong negative sentiment that isn\'t well founded. Indeed, the difference between NPE and IAE from a runtime perspective is strictly the name. From that perspective, the more precise you are with the name, the more clarity you give to the caller.\n', 'questionId': '3881', 'answerId': '1871889'}

{'answer': u'I have used JBoss Seam now for about a year and like it very much over Spring.  Unfortunately, I don\'t use this at work, more for side projects and personal projects.  For me, it saves me a lot of time developing new projects for clients.  And, one big reason I use it primarily is, the tight integration with each layer and I never get any lazy load errors that I used to get with Spring (even after the filter and other hacks).\nAn equivalent Spring application would have much more boilerplate code within it to get stuff working.  Spring does not integrate each layer very well, it more or less is a wrapper for a lot of different things, but doesn\'t glue itself together very well.\nThe other nice thing I like with Seam is they practice what they preach.  Take a look at their website.  Take a guess what it is running, hmm, a live example of their code.  Seam Wiki, Seam Forums, etc.  If you truly believe in your code, stand behind it.  I would be happy to have their pager 24x7x365, I bet it rarely goes off.\nWhile you write a lot less code, the learning curve is about twice as steep.  The further I get in, the more I understand how to write good code.  I would like to see more comments, but as far as coding style, it is well written.\nOn the negative side, just as any product you try to market, Seam was years after Spring had already become popular so Spring is by far still more popular.  Search on Indeed and Seam only has a few hits.  If you look on Spring, there are roughly 40k registered users, while Seam has about 7k.\nDepends on what is important to you, as a Java developer/engineer/programmer, you should be able to work with both technologies and chances are, you will most likely encounter a Spring application before a Seam one.  Learn both and how to leverage both.  If you use both properly and know the nuances and quirks of each, development becomes much easier whether you\'re using Spring or Seam.\nI don\'t agree with the statement, "Seam is the next Struts".  Struts was a view technology whereas Seam integrates all layers.  I will agree that it is a new concept like Struts and will bring the same impact to the Java community that Struts did.  I don\'t think we\'ll see that until Java EE 6 and CDI become more popular, and of course Seam 3 is released.\nWalter\n', 'questionId': '30281', 'answerId': '1983480'}

{'answer': u'I have implemented callback/delegate support in Java using reflection.  Details and working source are available on my website.\nHow It Works\nThere is a principle class named Callback with a nested class named WithParms.  The API which needs the callback will take a Callback object as a parameter and, if neccessary, create a Callback.WithParms as a method variable.  Since a great many of the applications of this object will be recursive, this works very cleanly.\nWith performance still a high priority to me, I didn\'t want to be required to create a throwaway object array to hold the parameters for every invocation - after all in a large data structure there could be thousands of elements, and in a message processing scenario we could end up processing thousands of data structures a second.\nIn order to be threadsafe the parameter array needs to exist uniquely for each invocation of the API method, and for efficiency the same one should be used for every invocation of the callback; I needed a second object which would be cheap to create in order to bind the callback with a parameter array for invocation.  But, in some scenarios, the invoker would already have a the parameter array for other reasons.  For these two reasons, the parameter array does not belong in the Callback object.  Also the choice of invocation (passing the parameters as an array or as individual objects) belongs in the hands of the API using the callback enabling it to use whichever invocation is  best suited to its inner workings.\nThe WithParms nested class, then, is optional and serves two purposes, it contains the parameter object array needed for the callback invocations, and it provides 10 overloaded invoke() methods (with from 1 to 10 parameters) which load the parameter array and then invoke the callback target.\nWhat follows is an example using a callback to process the files in a directory tree.  This is an initial validation pass which just counts the files to process and ensure none exceed a predetermined maximum size. In this case we just create the callback inline with the API invocation.  However, we reflect the target method out as a static value so that the reflection is not done every time.\n\nIoUtil.processDirectory():\n\nThis example illustrates the beauty of this approach - the application specific logic is abstracted into the callback, and the drudgery of recursively walking a directory tree is tucked nicely away in a completely reusable static utility method.  And we don\'t have to repeatedly pay the price of defining and implementing an interface for every new use. Of course, the argument for an interface is that it is far more explicit about what to implement (it\'s enforced, not simply documented) - but in practice I have not found it to be a problem to get the callback definition right.\nDefining and implementing an interface is not really so bad (unless you\'re distributing applets, as I am, where avoiding creating extra classes actually matters), but where this really shines is when you have multiple callbacks in a single class. Not only is being forced to push them each into a separate inner class added overhead in the deployed application, but it\'s downright tedious to program and all that boiler-plate code is really just "noise".\n', 'questionId': '44912', 'answerId': '2075606'}

In Tomcat they rename the Procrun binaries (prunsrv.exe -> tomcat6.exe, prunmgr.exe -> tomcat6w.exe).\nSomething I struggled with using Procrun, your start and stop methods must accept the parameters (String[] argv).

{'answer': u'With the release of Spring 2.5 and 3.0, I think one of the most important best practices to take advantage of now are the Spring annotations. Annotations for Controllers, Services, and Repositories can save you a ton of time, allow you to focus on the business logic of your app, and can potentially all you to make all of your object plain old Java objects (POJOs).\n', 'questionId': '8569', 'answerId': '2792809'}
{'answer': u'First of all Spring is about modularity and works best if one focuses on writing small components that do one thing and do it well. \nIf you follow best practices in general like:\n\nDefining an interface rather than abstract classes\nMaking types immutable\nKeep dependencies as few as possible for a single class.\nEach class should do one thing and do it well. Big monolithic classes suck, they are hard to test and hard to use.\n\nIf your components are small and follow the dogmas above they should be easy to wire up and play with other stuff. The above points are naturally also true of the Spring framework itself. \nPS\nDont listen to the points above, they are talking about how to do whatever. Its more important to learn how to think rather than how to do something. Humans can think, repeating something is not clever, thinking is.\n', 'questionId': '8569', 'answerId': '2792827'}
{'answer': u'I think the motive for this question is focused on the convenience of setup: Is there any distro that has Eclipse and the full Sun Java package (JRE, JDK, and DOCS) already "baked in" so that a manual install process (and deinstall of OpenJDK) is not required? \nHaving an "out-of-the-box" standardized environment for a development team is a huge time saver. If you don\'t already have access to a Java-experienced Linux SysAdmin to guide you through the process of rolling your own automated install, learning enough to do it yourself is definitely frustrating.\nFew Developers enjoy spending their time wrenching around with OS internals to get tools like Glassfish, Derby, Groovy, Grails, GWT, etc. all working together. They prefer to go directly to writing code and inventing stuff inside a personal sandbox that exploits a pre-existing ecosystem of built-in services...\nOn the deployment side, having a common Linux install that requires no system-level configuration for end-users except for installing their favorite Java applications\' .JAR file would be another big win. \nThere\'s definitely a market for someone to provide this, but most folks are simply gritting their teeth and doing it for themselves.\n', 'questionId': '48203', 'answerId': '2800145'}
{'answer': u"Finally is always run that's the whole point, just because it appears in the code after the return doesn't mean that that's how it's implemented.

Then there is a choice:\n\nIf the finally block completes normally, then the try statement completes abruptly for reason R. \nIf the finally block completes abruptly for reason S, then the try statement completes abruptly for reason S (and reason R is discarded).\n\n\n\nThe specification for return actually makes this explicit:\nJLS 14.17 The return Statement\n\n\nA return statement with no Expression attempts to transfer control to the invoker of the method or constructor that contains it. \nA return statement with an Expression attempts to transfer control to the invoker of the method that contains it; the value of the Expression becomes the value of the method invocation.\nThe preceding descriptions say "attempts to transfer control" rather than just "transfers control" because if there are any try statements within the method or constructor whose try blocks contain the return statement, then any finally clauses of those try statements will be executed, in order, innermost to outermost, before control is transferred to the invoker of the method or constructor.

{'answer': u"I would stick to ASCII characters because if anyone in your development team is using an SDK that only supports ASCII or you wanted to make your code open source, alot of problems could arise. Personally, I would not do it even if you are not planning on bringing anyone who doesn't speak the language in on the project, because you are running a business and it seems to me that one running a business would want his business to expand, which in this day and age means transcending national borders. My opinion is that English is the language of the realm, and even if you name your variables in a different language, there is little to no point to use any non-ASCII characters in your programming. Leave it up to the language to deal with it if you are handling data that is UTF8: my iPhone program (which involves tons of user data going in between the phone and server) has full UTF8 support, but has no UTF8 in the source code.

{'answer': u"Clearly, notify wakes (any) one thread in the wait set, notifyAll wakes all threads in the waiting set. The following discussion should clear up any doubts. notifyAll should be used most of the time. If you are not sure which to use, then use notifyAll.Please see explanation that follows.\nRead very carefully and understand. Please send me an email if you have any questions.\nLook at producer/consumer (assumption is a ProducerConsumer class with two methods). IT IS BROKEN (because it uses notify) - yes it MAY work - even most of the time, but it may also cause deadlock - we will see why:\n\nFIRSTLY,\nWhy do we need a while loop surrounding the wait?\nWe need a while loop in case we get this situation:\nConsumer 1 (C1) enter the synchronized block and the buffer is empty, so C1 is put in the wait set (via the wait call). Consumer 2 (C2) is about to enter the synchronized method (at point Y above), but Producer P1 puts an object in the buffer, and subsequently calls notify. The only waiting thread is C1, so it is woken and now attempts to re-acquire the object lock at point X (above).\nNow C1 and C2 are attempting to acquire the synchronization lock. One of them (nondeterministically) is chosen and enters the method, the other is blocked (not waiting - but blocked, trying to acquire the lock on the method). Let's say C2 gets the lock first. C1 is still blocking (trying to acquire the lock at X). C2 completes the method and releases the lock. Now, C1 acquires the lock. Guess what, lucky we have a while loop, because, C1 performs the loop check (guard) and is prevented from removing a non-existent element from the buffer (C2 already got it!). If we didn't have a while, we would get an IndexArrayOutOfBoundsException as C1 tries to remove the first element from the buffer!\nNOW,\nOk, now why do we need notifyAll?\nIn the producer/consumer example above it looks like we can get away with notify. It seems this way, because we can prove that the guards on the wait loops for producer and consumer are mutually exclusive. That is, it looks like we cannot have a thread waiting in the put method as well as the get method, because, for that to be true, then the following would have to be true:\nbuf.size() == 0 AND buf.size() == MAX_SIZE (assume MAX_SIZE is not 0)\nHOWEVER, this is not good enough, we NEED to use notifyAll. Let's see why ...\nAssume we have a buffer of size 1 (to make the example easy to follow). The following steps lead us to deadlock. Note that ANYTIME a thread is woken with notify, it can be non-deterministically selected by the JVM - that is any waiting thread can be woken. Also note that when multiple threads are blocking on entry to a method (i.e. trying to acquire a lock), the order of acquisition can be non-deterministic. Remember also that a thread can only be in one of the methods at any one time - the synchronized methods allow only one thread to be executing (i.e. holding the lock of) any (synchronized) methods in the class. If the following sequence of events occurs - deadlock results:\nSTEP 1:\n- P1 puts 1 char into the buffer\nSTEP 2:\n- P2 attempts put - checks wait loop - already a char - waits\nSTEP 3:\n- P3 attempts put - checks wait loop - already a char - waits\nSTEP 4:\n- C1 attempts to get 1 char \n- C2 attempts to get 1 char - blocks on entry to the get method\n- C3 attempts to get 1 char - blocks on entry to the get method\nSTEP 5:\n- C1 is executing the get method - gets the char, calls notify, exits method\n- The notify wakes up P2\n- BUT, C2 enters method before P2 can (P2 must reacquire the lock), so P2 blocks on entry to the put method\n- C2 checks wait loop, no more chars in buffer, so waits\n- C3 enters method after C2, but before P2, checks wait loop, no more chars in buffer, so waits\nSTEP 6:\n- NOW: there is P3, C2, and C3 waiting!\n- Finally P2 acquires the lock, puts a char in the buffer, calls notify, exits method\nSTEP 7:\n- P2's notification wakes P3 (remember any thread can be woken)\n- P3 checks the wait loop condition, there is already a char in the buffer, so waits.\n- NO MORE THREADS TO CALL NOTIFY and THREE THREADS PERMANENTLY SUSPENDED!\nSOLUTION: Replace notify with notifyAll in the producer/consumer code (above).\n", 'questionId': '37026', 'answerId': '3186336'}

But a delegate contains the target object\n  alongwith the method to be invoked. Ideally it would be nice to be\n  able to say:\nobj.registerHandler(ano.methodOne); \n..and that the method methodOne would be called on ano when some specific event was received.\nThis is what the Delegate structure achieves.\nJava Inner Classes \nIt has been argued that Java provides this\n  functionality via inner classes and thus does not need the additional\n  Delegate construct.\n\n\n\nAt first glance this seems correct but at the same time a nuisance.\n  Because for many event processing examples the simplicity of the\n  Delegates syntax is very attractive.\nGeneral Handler \nHowever, if event-based programming is used in a more\n  pervasive manner, say, for example, as a part of a general\n  asynchronous programming environment, there is more at stake.\nIn such a general situation, it is not sufficient to include only the\n  target method and target object instance. In general there may be\n  other parameters required, that are determined within the context when\n  the event handler is registered.\nIn this more general situation, the java approach can provide a very\n  elegant solution, particularly when combined with use of final\n  variables:\n\n\n\nfinal * final * final \nGot your attention?\nNote that the final variables are accessible from within the anonymous\n  class method definitions. Be sure to study this code carefully to\n  understand the ramifications. This is potentially a very powerful\n  technique. For example, it can be used to good effect when registering\n  handlers in MiniDOM and in more general situations.\nBy contrast, the Delegate construct does not provide a solution for\n  this more general requirement, and as such should be rejected as an\n  idiom on which designs can be based.\n\n', 'questionId': '44912', 'answerId': '3953773'}

{'answer': u"\nThe issue us that the connection does not close properly and is stuck in the 'sleep' mode\n\nThis was actually only half right.\nThe problem I ran into was actually that each app was defining a new connection to the database sever. So each time I closed all the connections App A would make a bunch of new connections as per it's WEB.xml config file and run happily. App B would do the same. The problem is that they are independent pools which try to grab up to the server defined limit. It is a kind of race condition I guess. So when App A has finished with the connections it sits waiting to to use them again until the timeout has passed while App B who needs the connection now is denied the resources even though App A has finished with the and should be back in the pool. Once the timeout has passed, the connection is freed up and B (or C etc) can get at it again.\ne.g. if the limit is 10 (mySQL profile limit) and each app has been configured to use a max of 10 the there will be 20 attempts at connections. Obviously this is a bad situation.\nThe solution is to RTFM and put the connection details in the right place.

{'answer': u'Basically, you have two main XML parsing methods in Java :\n\nSAX, where you use an handler to only grab what you want in your XML and ditch the rest\nDOM, which parses your file all along, and allows you to grab all elements in a more tree-like fashion.\n\nAnother very useful XML parsing method, albeit a little more recent than these ones, and included in the JRE only since Java6, is StAX. StAX was conceived as a medial method between the tree-based of DOM and event-based approach of SAX. It is quite similar to SAX in the fact that parsing very large documents is easy, but in this case the application "pulls" info from the parser, instead of the parsing "pushing" events to the application.

{'answer': u'We\'ve been using Stripes for about 4 years now. Our stack is Stripes/EJB3/JPA.\nMany use Stripes plus Stripernate as a single, full stack solution. We don\'t because we want our business logic within the EJB tier, so we simply rely on JPA Entities as combined Model and DTO.\nStripes does the binding to our Entities/DTO and we shove them back in to the EJB tier for work. For most of our CRUD stuff this is very thing and straightforward, making our 80% use case trivial to work with. Yet we have the flexibility to do whatever we want for the edge cases that always come up with complicate applications.\nWe have a very large base Action Bean which encapsulates the bulk of our CRUD operations that makes call backs in to the individual subclasses specific to the entities and forms.\nWe also have a large internal tag file library to manage our pages, security, navigation, tasks, etc. A simple CRUD edit form is little more than a list of field names, and we get all of the chrome and menus and access controls "for free".\nThe beauty of this is that we get to keep the HTTP request based metaphor that we like and we get to choose the individual parts of the system rather than use one fat stack. The Stripes layer is lean and mean, and never gets in our way.\nWe have a bunch of Ajax integrating YUI and JQuery, all working against our Stripes and EJB stack painlessly.\nI also ported a lighter version of the stack to GAE for a sample project, basically having to do minor work to our EJB tier. So, the entire stack is very nimble and amicable to change. Stripes is a big factor of that since we let it do the few things that it does, and does very well. Then delegate the rest to other parts of the stack.\nAs always there are parts folks would rather have different at times, but Stripes would be the last part to go in our stack, frankly.

{'answer': u'There is a LOT to be said in taking the time to test out the various garbage collection settings, but as was mentioned above it usually not useful to do so.\nI am currently working on a project involving a memory-limited environment and a relatively large amounts of data--there are a few large pieces of data that push my environment to its limit, and even though I was able to bring memory usage down so that in theory it should work just fine, I would still get heap space errors---the verbose GC options showed me that it was trying to garbage collect, but to no avail. In the debugger, I could perform System.gc() and sure enough there would be "plenty" of memory available...not a lot of extra, but enough.\nConsequently, The only time my application calls System.gc() is when it is about to enter the segment of code where large buffers necessary for processing the data will be allocated, and a test on the free memory available indicates that I\'m not guaranteed to have it.  In particular, I\'m looking at a 1gb environment where at least 300mb is occupied by static data, with the bulk of the non-static data being execution-related except when the data being processed happens to be at least 100-200 MB at the source.  It\'s all part of an automatic data conversion process, so the data all exists for relatively short periods of time in the long run.\nUnfortunately, while information about the various options for tuning the garbage collector is available, it seems largely an experimental process and the lower level specifics needed to understand how to handle these specific situations are not easily obtained.  \nAll of that being said, even though I am using System.gc(), I still continued to tune using command line parameters and managed to improve the overall processing time of my application by a relatively significant amount, despite being unable to get over the stumbling block posed by working with the larger blocks of data.   That being said, System.gc() is a tool....a very unreliable tool, and if you are not careful with how you use it, you will wish that it didn\'t work more often than not.\n', 'questionId': '66540', 'answerId': '5217683'}

{'answer': u'The real problem with closing OS handles in finalize is that the finalize are executed in no guaranteed order. But if you have handles to the things that block (think e.g. sockets) potentially your code can get into deadlock situation (not trivial at all).\nSo I\'m for explicitly closing handles in a predictable orderly manner. Basically code for dealing with resources should follow the pattern:\n\nIt gets even more complicated if you write your own classes that work via JNI and open handles. You need to make sure handles are closed (released) and that it will happen only once. Frequently overlooked OS handle in Desktop J2SE is Graphics[2D]. Even BufferedImage.getGrpahics() can potentially return you the handle that points into a video driver (actually holding the resource on GPU). If you won\'t release it yourself and leave it  garbage collector to do the work - you may find strange OutOfMemory and alike situation when you ran out of video card mapped bitmaps but still have plenty of memory. In my experience it happens rather frequently in tight loops working with graphics objects (extracting thumbnails, scaling, sharpening you name it).\nBasically GC does not take care of programmers responsibility of correct resource management. It only takes care of memory and nothing else. The Stream.finalize calling close() IMHO would be better implemented throwing exception new RuntimeError("garbage collecting the stream that is still open"). It will save hours and days of debugging and cleaning code after the sloppy amateurs left the ends lose.\nHappy coding.\nPeace.\n', 'questionId': '28949', 'answerId': '5388006'}

{'answer': u"While it's possible that this is due to a classpath mismatch between compile-time and run-time, it's not necessarily true.\nIt is important to keep two or three different exceptions straight in our head in this case:\n\njava.lang.ClassNotFoundException  This exception indicates that the class was not found on the classpath.  This indicates that we were trying to load the class definition, and the class did not exist on the classpath.\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError  This exception indicates that the JVM looked in its internal class definition data structure for the definition of a class and did not find it.  This is different than saying that it could not be loaded from the classpath.  Usually this indicates that we previously attempted to load a class from the classpath, but it failed for some reason - now we're trying to use the class again (and thus need to load it, since it failed last time), but we're not even going to try to load it, because we failed loading it earlier (and reasonably suspect that we would fail again).

{'answer': u"I started using mocks with EasyMock. Easy enough to understand, but the replay step was kinda annoying. Mockito removes this, also has a cleaner syntax as it looks like readability was one of its primary goals. I cannot stress enough how important this is, since most of developers will spend their time reading and maintaining existing code, not creating it. \nAnother nice thing is that interfaces and implementation classes are handled in the same way, unlike in EasyMock where still you need to remember (and check) to use an EasyMock Class Extension.\nI've taken a quick look at JMockit recently, and while the laundry list of features is pretty comprehensive, I think the price of this is legibility of resulting code, and having to write more. \nFor me, Mockito hits the sweet spot, being easy to write and read, and dealing with majority of the situations most code will require. Using Mockito with PowerMock would be my choice.\nOne thing to consider is that the tool you would choose if you were developing by yourself, or in a small tight-knit team, might not be the best to get for a large company with developers of varying skill levels. Readability, ease of use and simplicity would need more consideration in the latter case.

{'answer': u'I have been thinking a lot about the topic of this very interesting question in\nthe last few days. First of all, if I have understood correctly, Java already has\nsome basic notion of closures (defined through anonymous classes) but the new feature\nthat is going to be introduced is the support for closures based on anonymous functions.\nThis extension will definitely make the language more expressive but I am not sure\nif it really fits with the rest of the language.\nJava has been designed as an object-oriented language with no support for functional programming: Will the new semantics be easy to understand? Java 6 does not even have functions, will Java 7 have anonymous functions but no "normal" functions?\nMy impression is that as new programming styles or paradigms like functional\nprogramming become more popular, everyone wants to use them in their\nfavourite OOP language. This is understandable: one wants to continue to use\na language they\'re familiar with while adopting new features. But in this way\na language can become really complex and lose coherence.\nSo my attitude at the moment is to stick to Java 6 for OOP (I hope Java 6 will still\nbe supported for a while) and, in case I really get interested in doing OOP + FP,\nto take a look at some other language like Scala (Scala was defined to be multi-\nparadigm from the beginning and can be well integrated with Java) rather than switching\nto Java 7.\nI think Java owes its success to the fact that it combines a simple language with very\npowerful libraries and tools, and I do not think that new features like closures will\nmake it a better programming language.\n', 'questionId': '50255', 'answerId': '6455738'}

{'answer': u'This will give you some insights of how Java really works to the point that in your next discussion about Java passing by reference or passing by value you\'ll just smile :-)\nStep one please erase from your mind that word that starts with \'p\' "_ _ _ _ _ _ _", especially if you come from other programming languages. Java and \'p\' cannot be written in the same book, forum, or even txt.\nStep two remember that when you pass an Object into a method you\'re passing the Object reference and not the Object itself.\n\nStudent: Master, does this mean that Java is pass-by-reference?\nMaster: Grasshopper, No.\n\nNow think of what an Object\'s reference/variable does/is:\n\nA variable holds the bits that tell the JVM how to get to the referenced Object in memory (Heap).\nWhen passing arguments to a method you ARE NOT passing the reference variable, but a copy of the bits in the reference variable. Something like this: 3bad086a. 3bad086a represents a way to get to the passed object.\nSo you\'re just passing 3bad086a that it\'s the value of the reference.\nYou\'re passing the value of the reference and not the reference itself (and not the object).\nThis value is actually COPIED and given to the method. \n\nIn the following (please don\'t try to compile/execute this...):\n\nWhat happens?\n\nThe variable person is created in line #1 and it\'s null at the beginning.\nA new Person Object is created in line #2, stored in memory, and the variable person is given the reference to the Person object. That is, its address. Let\'s say 3bad086a.\nThe variable person holding the address of the Object is passed to the function in line #3.\nIn line #4 you can listen to the sound of silence \nCheck the comment on line #5\nA method local variable -anotherReferenceToTheSamePersonObject- is created and then comes the magic in line #6:\n\n\nThe variable/reference person is copied bit-by-bit and passed to anotherReferenceToTheSamePersonObject inside the function.\nNo new instances of Person are created.\nBoth "person" and "anotherReferenceToTheSamePersonObject" hold the same value of 3bad086a.\nDon\'t try this but person==anotherReferenceToTheSamePersonObject would be true.\nBoth variables have IDENTICAL COPIES of the reference and they both refer to the same Person Object, the SAME Object on the Heap and NOT A COPY.\n\n\nA picture is worth a thousand words:\n\nNote that the anotherReferenceToTheSamePersonObject arrows is directed towards the Object and not towards the variable person!\nIf you didn\'t get it then just trust me and remember that it\'s better to say that Java is pass by value. Well, pass by reference value. Oh well, even better is pass-by-copy-of-the-variable-value! ;)\nNow feel free to hate me but note that given this there is no difference between passing primitive data types and Objects when talking about method arguments.\nYou always pass a copy of the bits of the value of the reference!\n\nIf it\'s a primitive data type these bits will contain the value of the primitive data type itself.\nIf it\'s an Object the bits will contain the value of the address that tells the JVM how to get to the Object.\n\n\nJava is pass-by-value because inside a method you can modify the referenced Object as much as you want but no matter how hard you try you\'ll never be able to modify the passed variable that will keep referencing (not p _ _ _ _ _ _ _) the same Object no matter what!\n\n\n\nThe changeName function above will never be able to modify the actual content (the bit values) of the passed reference. In other word changeName cannot make Person person refer to another Object.\n\n\nOf course you can cut it short and just say that  Java is pass-by-value!\n', 'questionId': '40480', 'answerId': '7034719'}

{'answer': u'This question is often asked in interview to check whether candidate understands correct usage of collection classes and is aware of alternative solutions available.\n\nThe HashMap class is roughly equivalent to Hashtable, except that it is non synchronized and permits nulls. (HashMap allows null values as key and value whereas Hashtable doesn\'t allow nulls).\nHashMap does not guarantee that the order of the map will remain constant over time.\nHashMap is non synchronized whereas Hashtable is synchronized.\nIterator in the HashMap is  fail-safe while the enumerator for the Hashtable is not and throw ConcurrentModificationException if any other Thread modifies the map structurally  by adding or removing any element except Iterator\'s own remove()  method. But this is not a guaranteed behavior and will be done by JVM on best effort.\n\nNote on Some Important Terms    \n\nSynchronized means only one thread can modify a hash table at one point of time. Basically, it means that any thread before performing an update on a hashtable will have to acquire a lock on the object while others will wait for lock to be released.\nFail-safe is relevant from the context of iterators. If an iterator has been created on a collection object and some other thread tries to modify the collection object "structurally", a concurrent modification exception will be thrown. It is possible for other threads though to invoke "set" method since it doesn\'t modify the collection "structurally". However, if prior to calling "set", the collection has been modified structurally, "IllegalArgumentException" will be thrown.\nStructurally modification means deleting or inserting element which could effectively change the structure of map.\n\nHashMap can be synchronized by\nMap m = Collections.synchronizeMap(hashMap);\nMap provides Collection views instead of direct support for iteration\n via Enumeration objects. Collection views greatly enhance the\n expressiveness of the interface, as discussed later in this section.\n Map allows you to iterate over keys, values, or key-value pairs;\n Hashtable does not provide the third option. Map provides a safe way\n to remove entries in the midst of iteration; Hashtable did not.\n Finally, Map fixes a minor deficiency in the Hashtable interface.\n Hashtable has a method called contains, which returns true if the\n Hashtable contains a given value. Given its name, you\'d expect this\n method to return true if the Hashtable contained a given key, because\n the key is the primary access mechanism for a Hashtable. The Map\n interface eliminates this source of confusion by renaming the method\n containsValue. Also, this improves the interface\'s consistency \u2014\n containsValue parallels containsKey.\n\nThe Map Interface\n\n', 'questionId': '40471', 'answerId': '7644118'}

{'answer': u'One big disadvantage of Java\'s tracing GC is that from time to time it will  "stop the world" and freeze the application for a relatively long time to do a full GC. If the heap is big and the the object tree complex, it will freeze for a few seconds. Also each full GC visits the whole object tree over and over again, something that is probably quite inefficient. Another drawback of the way Java does GC is that you have to tell the jvm what heap size you want (if the default is not good enough); the JVM derives from that value several thresholds that will trigger the GC process when there is too much garbage stacking up in the heap.\nI presume that this is actually the main cause of the jerky feeling of Android (based on Java), even on the most expensive cellphones, in comparison with the smoothness of iOS (based on ObjectiveC, and using RC). \nI\'d love to see a jvm option to enable RC memory management, and maybe keeping GC only to run as a last resort when there is no more memory left. \n', 'questionId': '21934', 'answerId': '7826363'}

{'answer': u'I was all in favour of throwing IllegalArgumentException for null parameters, until today, when I noticed the java.util.Objects.requireNonNull method in Java 7.  With that method, instead of doing:\n\nyou can do:\n\nand it will throw a NullPointerException if the parameter you pass it is null.\nGiven that that method is right bang in the middle of java.util I take its existence to be a pretty strong indication that throwing NullPointerException is "the Java way of doing things".\nI think I\'m decided at any rate.\nNote that the arguments about hard debugging are bogus because you can of course provide a message to NullPointerException saying what was null and why it shouldn\'t be null.  Just like with IllegalArgumentException.\nOne added advantage of NullPointerException is that, in highly performance critical code, you could dispense with an explicit check for null (and a NullPointerException with a friendly error message), and just rely on the NullPointerException you\'ll get automatically when you call a method on the null parameter.  Provided you call a method quickly (i.e. fail fast), then you have essentially the same effect, just not quite as user friendly for the developer.  Most times it\'s probably better to check explicitly and throw with a useful message to indicate which parameter was null, but it\'s nice to have the option of changing that if performance dictates without breaking the published contract of the method/constructor.\n', 'questionId': '3881', 'answerId': '8196334'}

{'answer': u"Aspect-oriented programming lets you trap assignments or fetches and attach intercepting logic to them, which I propose is the right way to solve the problem.  (The issue of whether they should be public or protected or package-protected is orthogonal.)\nThus you start out with unintercepted fields with the right access qualifier.  As your program requirements grow you attach logic to perhaps validate, make a copy of the object being returned, etc.\nThe getter/setter philosophy imposes costs on a large number of simple cases where they are not needed.\nWhether aspect-style is cleaner or not is somewhat qualitative.  I would find it easy to see just the variables in a class and view the logic separately.  In fact, the raison d'etre for Apect-oriented programming is that many concerns are cross-cutting and compartmentalizing them in the class body itself is not ideal (logging being an example -- if you want to log all gets Java wants you to write a whole bunch of getters and keeping them in sync but AspectJ allows you a one-liner).\nThe issue of IDE is a red-herring. It is not so much the typing as it is the reading and visual pollution that arises from get/sets.\nAnnotations seem similar to aspect-oriented programming at first sight however they require you to exhaustively enumerate pointcuts by attaching annotations, as opposed to a concise wild-card-like pointcut specification in AspectJ.\nI hope awareness of AspectJ prevents people from prematurely settling on dynamic languages.\n", 'questionId': '36701', 'answerId': '8566099'}

{'answer': u"Unlike others I think there are many reasons why you might always want the latest version. Particularly if you are doing continuous deployment (we sometimes have like 5 releases in a day) and don't want to do a multi-module project.\nWhat I do is make Hudson/Jenkins do the following for every build:\n\nThat is I use the versions plugin and scm plugin to update the dependencies and then check it in to source control. Yes I let my CI do SCM checkins (which you have to do anyway for the maven release plugin).\nYou'll want to setup the versions plugin to only update what you want:\n\nI use the release plugin to do the release which takes care of -SNAPSHOT and validates that there is a release version of -SNAPSHOT (which is important).\nIf you do what I do you will get the latest version for all snapshot builds and the latest release version for release builds. Your builds will also be reproducible.\nUpdate\nI noticed some comments asking some specifics of this workflow. I will say we don't use this method anymore and the big reason why is the maven versions plugin is buggy and in general is inherently flawed.\nIt is flawed because to run the versions plugin to adjust versions all the existing versions need to exist for the pom to run correctly. That is the versions plugin cannot update to the latest version of anything if it can't find the version referenced in the pom. This is actually rather annoying as we often cleanup old versions for disk space reasons.\nReally you need a separate tool from maven to adjust the versions (so you don't depend on the pom file to run correctly). I have written such a tool in the the lowly language that is Bash. The script will update the versions like the version plugin and check the pom back into source control. It also runs like 100x faster than the mvn versions plugin. Unfortunately it isn't written in a manner for public usage but if people are interested I could make it so and put it in a gist or github.\nGoing back to workflow as some comments asked about that this is what we do:\n\nWe have 20 or so projects in their own repositories with their own jenkins jobs\nWhen we release the maven release plugin is used. The workflow of that is covered in the plugin's documentation. The maven release plugin sort of sucks (and I'm being kind) but it does work. One day we plan on replacing this method with something more optimal.\nWhen one of the projects gets released jenkins then runs a special job we will call the update all versions job (how jenkins knows its a release is a complicated manner in part because the maven jenkins release plugin is pretty crappy as well).\nThe update all versions job knows about all the 20 projects. It is actually an aggregator pom to be specific with all the projects in the modules section in dependency order. Jenkins runs our magic groovy/bash foo that will pull all the projects update the versions to the latest and then checkin the poms (again done in dependency order based on the modules section). \nFor each project if the pom has changed (because of a version change in some dependency) it is checked in and then we immediately ping jenkins to run the corresponding job for that project (this is to preserve build dependency order otherwise you are at the mercy of the SCM Poll scheduler). \n\nAt this point I'm of the opinion it is a good thing to have the release and auto version a separate tool from your general build anyway.\nNow you might think maven sort of sucks because of the problems listed above but this actually would be fairly difficult with a build tool that does not have a declarative easy to parse extendable syntax (aka XML).\nIn fact we add custom XML attributes through namespaces to help hint bash/groovy scripts (e.g. don't update this version). \n", 'questionId': '30571', 'answerId': '8795380'}

C# as a language is years ahead of Java IMHO and the .NET framework is a joy to use. Most of what is being added in Java 7 and Java 8 has been in C# for years. JVM languages like Scala and Clojure (both available on the CLR) are pretty nice though.\nI see Mono as a platform in it's own right (a great one) and treat .NET as the Microsoft implementation of Mono on Windows. This means that I develop and test on Mono first. This works wonderfully.\nIf both Java and .NET (Mono let's say) were Open Source projects without any corporate backing, I would choose Mono over Java every time. I believe it is just a better platform.\nBoth .NET/Mono and the JVM are great choices, although I would personally use some other language than Java on the JVM.\nMy take on some of the other comments:\nIssue: Performance.\n**Answer: Both the JVM and the CLR perform better than detractors say they do. I would say that the JVM performs better. Mono is generally slower than .NET (though not always).\nI personally would take ASP.NET MVC over J2EE any day both as a developer and an end-user. Support for Google Native Client is pretty cool too. Also, I know that poor GUI performance for desktop Java apps is supposed to be a thing of the past but I keep finding slow ones. Then again, I could say the same for WPF. GTK# is plenty fast though so there is no reason they have to be slow.\nIssue: Java has a larger ecosystem of libraries available.\nAnswer: Probably true, but it is a non-issue in practice.\nPractically every Java library (including the JDK) runs just dandy on .NET/Mono thanks to IKVM.NET. This piece of technology is a true marvel. The integration is amazing; you can use a Java library just like it was native. I have only had to use Java libraries in one .NET app though. The .NET/Mono ecosystem generally offers more than I need.\nIssue: Java has better (broader) tools support\nAnswer: Not on Windows. Otherwise I agree. MonoDevelop is nice though.\nI want to give a shout-out to MonoDevelop; it is a jewel. MonoDevelop integrates most of the tools I want use including code completion (intellisense), Git/Subversion integration, support for unit tests, SQL integration, debugging, easy refactoring, and assembly browsing with on-the-fly decompilation. It is wonderful to use the same environment for everything from server-side web to mobile apps.\nIssue: Compatibility across platforms.\nAnswer: Mono is a single code-base across all platforms, including Windows.\nDevelop for Mono first and deploy to .NET on Windows if you like. If you compare .NET from MS to Java though then Java has the edge in terms of consistency across platforms. See next answer...\nIssue: Mono lags .NET.\nAnswer: No it does not. IMHO, this is an often stated but incorrect statement.\nThe Mono distribution from Xamarin ships with C#, VB.NET, F#, IronPython, IronRuby, and I think maybe Boo out of the box. The Mono C# compiler is completely up to date with MS. The Mono VB.NET compiler does lag the MS version. The other compilers are the same on both platforms (as are other .NET languages like Nemerle, Boo, and Phalanger (PHP) ).\nMono ships with a lot of the actual Microsoft written code including the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR), Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF), F#, and ASP.NET MVC. Because Razor is not Open Source, Mono currently ships with MVC2 but MVC3 works on Mono just fine.\nThe core Mono platform has kept pace with .NET or many years and the compatibility is impressive. You can use the full C# 4.0 language and even some C# 5.0 features today. In fact, Mono often leads .NET in many ways.\nMono implements parts of the CLR spec that even Microsoft does not support (like 64 bit arrays). One of the most exciting new pieces of technology in the .NET world is Rosylyn. Mono has offered the C# compiler as a service for many years. Some of what Rosylyn offers is available via NRefractory as well. An example of were Mono is still ahead would be the SIMD instructions to accelerate gaming performance.\nMicrosoft does offer a number of products on top of .NET that are not available in Mono which is were the misconception about Mono lagging comes from. Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Entity Framework (EF), WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) are examples of products which do not work, or are poorly supported, on Mono. The obvious solution is to use cross-platform alternatives like GTK#, NHibernate, and ServiceStack instead.\nIssue: Microsoft is evil.\nAnswer: True. So what.\nMany people offer the following reasons to avoid using Mono:\n1) You should not use Mono because Microsoft tech should be avoided\n2) Mono sucks because it does not let you use every technology that Microsoft offers\nTo me, it is clear that these statements are incompatible. I reject the first statement but will skip that argument here. The second statement is true of all .NET alternatives.\nThe JVM is a great platform and the explosion of JVM languages is awesome. Use what makes you happy. For now, that is often .NET/Mono for me.\n", 'questionId': '61559', 'answerId': '9049008'}

After all, by the point the constructor fails, the object's name field has already been initialized, right?\nWell, Java can't return a partially constructed version of A because the object was not successfully built. The object is in a inconsistent state, and it is therefore discarded by Java. Your variable A is not even initialized, it is kept as null. \nNow, as you know, to fully build a new object, all its super classes must be initialized first. If one of the super classes failed to execute, what would be the final state of the object? It is impossible to determine that.\nLook at this more elaborate example\n\nWhen the constructor of C is invoked, if an exception occurs while initializing B, what would be the value of the final int variable b?\nAs such, the object C cannot be created, it is bogus, it is trash, it is not fully initialized.\nFor me, this explains why your code is illegal.\n", 'questionId': '5328', 'answerId': '10261194'}

Since I'm going back to do some modeling and also getting some replies to the post I decided to install papyrus again, and will investigate other possible uml modeling solutions again. Uml generation (with synchronization feature) is really important not to software designer but to the average developer.\nI wish papyrus had straightforward way to Reverse Engineer classes into UML class diagram and It would be super cool if that reverse engineering had a synchronization feature, but unfortunately papyrus project is full of features and I think developers there have already much at hand since also many actions you do over papyrus might not give you any response and just nothing happens but that's out of this question scope anyway.\nThe Answer (Oct 11th 2013)\nTools\n\nDownloaded Eclipse Kepler Modeling\nHelp-> Install modeling components-> papyrus\nAfter installation finishes restart\nAgain Help -> Install modeling components -> Modisco\n\nSteps\n\nIn your java project (assume it's called MyProject) create a folder e.g UML\nRight click over the project name -> Discovery -> Discoverer -> Discover Java and inventory model from java project, a file called MyProject_kdm.xmi will be generated.\n\nRight click project name file --> new --> papyrus model -> and call it MyProject.\nMove the three generated files MyProject.di , MyProject.notation, MyProject.uml to the UML folder\nRight click on MyProject_kdm.xmi -> Discovery -> Discoverer -> Discover UML model from KDM code again you'll get a property dialog set the serialization prop to TRUE to generate a file named MyProject.uml \n\nMove generated MyProject.uml which was generated at root, to UML folder, Eclipse will ask you If you wanted to replace it click yes. What we did in here was that we replaced an empty model with a generated one.\nALT+W -> show view -> papyrus -> model explorer\nIn that view you'll find your classes like in the picture \n\nIn the view Right click root model -> New diagram \nThen start grabbing classes to the diagram from the view\n\nSome features\n\nTo show the class elements (variables, functions etc) Right click on any class -> Filters -> show/hide contents  Voila !!\nYou can have default friendly color settings from Window -> pereferences -> papyrus -> class diagram\none very important setting is Arrange when you drop the classes they get cramped right click on any empty space at class diagram and click Arrange All\nArrows in the model explorer view can be grabbed to the diagram to show generalization, realization etc\nAfter all of that your settings will show diagrams like \n\nSince Synchronization isn't available as far as I know you'll need to manually import any new classes.\n\nThat's all, And don't buy commercial products unless you really need it, papyrus is actually great and sophisticated instead donate or something.\nDisclaimer: I've no relation to the papyrus people infact i didn't like papyrus at first until I did lots of research and experienced it with some patience.

{'answer': u'I have worked out how to calculate sensible dynamic facets for product price ranges.  The solution involves some pre-processing of documents and some post-processing of the query results, but it requires only one query to Solr, and should even work on old version of Solr like 1.4.\nRound up prices before submission\nFirst, before submitting the document, round up the the price to the nearest "nice round facet boundary" and store it in a "rounded_price" field.  Users like their facets to look like "250-500" not "247-483", and rounding also means you get back hundreds of price facets not millions of them.  With some effort the following code can be generalised to round nicely at any price scale:\n\nPermissible prices go 1,2,3,...,24,25,30,35,...,95,100,110,...,240,250,275,300,325,...,975,1000 and so forth.  \nGet all facets on rounded prices\nSecond, when submitting the query, request all facets on rounded prices sorted by price: facet.field=rounded_price.  Thanks to the rounding, you\'ll get at most a few hundred facets back.\nCombine adjacent facets into larger facets\nThird, after you have the results, the user wants see only 3 to 7 facets, not hundreds of facets.  So, combine adjacent facets into a few large facets (called "segments") trying to get a roughly equal number of documents in each segment. The following rather more complicated code does this, returning tuples of (start, end, count) suitable for performing range queries.  The counts returned will be correct provided prices were been rounded up to the nearest boundary:\n\nFilter results by selected facet\nFourth, suppose ("250","500",38) was one of the resulting segments.  If the user selects "$250 to $500" as a filter, simply do a filter query fq=price:[250 TO 500]\n', 'questionId': '33956', 'answerId': '11329853'}

{'answer': u'I came here because I also ran into this question in The Passionate Programmer, by Chad Fowler. For those who don\'t have access to a copy, the question is framed as a kind of filter/test for candidates interviewing for a position requiring "really good Java programmers."\nSpecifically, he asks:\n\nHow would you write a program, in pure Java, that would cause the Java Virtual Machine to crash?\n\nI\'ve programmed in Java for over 15 years, and I found this question to be both puzzling and unfair. As others have pointed out, Java, as a managed language, is specifically designed not to crash. Of course there are always JVM bugs, but:\n\nAfter 15+ years of production-level JREs, it\'s rare.\nAny such bugs are likely to be patched in the next release, so how likely are you as a programmer to run into and recall the details of the current set of JRE show-stoppers?\n\nAs others have mentioned, some native code via JNI is a sure way to crash a JRE. But the author specifically mentioned in pure Java, so that\'s out.\nAnother option would be to feed the JRE bogus byte codes; it\'s easy enough to dump some garbage binary data to a .class file, and ask the JRE to run it:\n\nDoes that count? I mean the JRE itself hasn\'t crashed; it properly detected the bogus code, reported it, and exited. \nThis leaves us with the most obvious kinds of solutions such as blowing the stack via recursion, running out of heap memory via object allocations, or simply throwing RuntimeException. But this just causes the JRE to exit with a StackOverflowError or similar exception, which, again is not really a crash.\nSo what\'s left? I\'d really love to hear what the author really had in mind as a proper solution.\nUpdate: Chad Fowler responded here.\nPS: it\'s an otherwise great book.

{'answer': u'It\'s really quite, quite simple:\nFor a variable of primitive type (eg. int, boolean, char, etc...), when you use its name for a method argument, you are passing the value contained in it (5, true, or \'c\').

String, Object, etc...), when you use its name for a method argument, you are passing the value contained in it (the reference value that "points" to the object). This reference value gets "copied", and the variable retains its value even after the method invocation. The reference variable keeps "pointing" to the same object.\nEither way, you\'re always passing stuff by value.\n\nCompare this to say C++ where you can have a method to take an int&, or in C# where you could have take a ref int (although, in this case, you also have to use the ref modifier when passing the variable\'s name to the method.)\n', 'questionId': '40480', 'answerId': '11764499'}
{'answer': u'Java 5 introduced several major updates, such as language improvements (i.e. Annotations, Generics, Autoboxing, and improved syntax for looping) among many others. Annotation is a mechanism for tagging classes with metadata so that, they can be used by metadata-aware programs. Generics is a mechanism of specifying types for objects belonging to collections, such as Arraylists, so that type safety is guaranteed at compile time. Autoboxing allows the automatic conversions between primitive types (e.g. int) and wrapper types (e.g. Integer). Improved syntax for looping includes the enhancements for each loop for going through the items of array or collections comparatively easily.\nJava 6 focuses on new specifications and APIs including XML, Web Services, JDBC version 4.0, programming based on Annotations, API\u2019s for Java compiler and Application client GUI.With new compiler API added with Java 6, the java compiler can now receive and/or send output to an abstraction of the file system (programs can specify/process compiler output). Furthermore, Java 6 added enhancements to the applications GUI capabilities in AWT (faster splash screens and support for system tray) and SWING (better drag-and-drop, support for customizing layouts, multithreading enhancements and ability to write GIF images).\n', 'questionId': '63042', 'answerId': '11788474'}

{'answer': u'the Intelligent Parameter Utilization Tool (InPUT, page) allows to externalize almost any (hard coded) decision as a parameter into an XML based configuration file. It has been initiated in early 2012 as a response to the perceived deficiencies in existing configuration tools with respect to generality, and separation of concerns.\nInPUT is probably more powerful than most use cases require, as it allows for the programming language independent formulation of experimental data (input - output), with features such as the definition of complex descriptor to class mappings, or randomized configuration spawning and validation based on predefined value ranges (for test and research, e.g. Monte Carlo simulations). You can define parameters with sub parameters, relative restrictions on parameter values (numerical param a > param b) etc. .\nIts still in beta, but rather stable, I use it for my research, for the configuration and documentation of experiments, and for teaching purposes. Once it is available for other languages (C++ adapter in the pipe), other researchers/practitioners can reuse the descriptors running their implementations of the same algorithms in C++ (using the code mapping concept). That way, experimental results can be validated/programs can be migrated more easily. The documentation is still in working process, but a couple of examples are available on the page.

The encoding specifies how you wish to represent your characters as bytes, so you can\'t really ignore the issue.

Surprisingly, "these are not included in the Java library" even though the \'opposite\' classes, InputStreamReader and OutputStreamWriter are included.\nSo, lots of people have come up with their own implementations, including Apache Commons IO.

{'answer': u'Some collections assume that null is rejected using NullPointerException rather than IllegalArgumentException. For example, if you compare a set containing null to a set that rejects null, the first set will call containsAll on the other and catch its NullPointerException -- but not IllegalArgumentException. (I\'m looking at the implementation of AbstractSet.equals.)\nYou could reasonably argue that using unchecked exceptions in this way is an antipattern, that comparing collections that contain null to collections that can\'t contain null is a likely bug that really should produce an exception, or that putting null in a collection at all is a bad idea.

{'answer': u'Throwing an exception that\'s exclusive to null arguments (whether NullPointerException or a custom type) makes automated null testing more reliable.

For example, NullPointerTester would attempt to call the following method...\n\n...with two lists of arguments: "", null and null, ImmutableList.of(). It would test that each of these calls throws the expected NullPointerException. For this implementation, passing a null list does not produce NullPointerException. It does, however, happen to produce an IllegalArgumentException because NullPointerTester happens to use a default string of "". If NullPointerTester expects only NullPointerException for null values, it catches the bug. If it expects IllegalArgumentException, it misses it.\n', 'questionId': '3881', 'answerId': '13312050'}

{'answer': u'HashMap and Hashtable have significant algorithmic differences as well. No one has mentioned this before so that\'s why I am bringing it up. HashMap will construct a hash table with power of two size, increase it dynamically such that you have at most about eight elements (collisions) in any bucket and will stir the elements very well for general element types. However, the Hashtable implementation provides better and finer control over the hashing if you know what you are doing, namely you can fix the table size using e.g. the closest prime number to your values domain size and this will result in better performance than HashMap i.e. less collisions for some cases.\nSeparate from the obvious differences discussed extensively in this question, I see the Hashtable as a "manual drive" car where you have better control over the hashing and the HashMap as the "automatic drive" counterpart that will generally perform well.\n', 'questionId': '40471', 'answerId': '13797704'}

{'answer': u'Actually, the question of throwing IllegalArgumentException or NullPointerException is in my humble view only a "holy war" for a minority with an incomlete understanding of exception handling in Java. In general, the rules are simple, and as follows:\n\nargument constraint violations must be indicated as fast as possible (-> fast fail), in order to avoid illegal states which are much harder to debug\nin case of an invalid null pointer for whatever reason, throw NullPointerException\nin case of an illegal array/collection index, throw ArrayIndexOutOfBounds\nin case of a negative array/collection size, throw NegativeArraySizeException\nin case of an illegal argument that is not covered by the above, and for which you don\'t have another more specific exception type, throw IllegalArgumentException as a wastebasket\non the other hand, in case of a constraint violation WITHIN A FIELD that could not be avoided by fast fail for some valid reason, catch and rethrow as IllegalStateException or a more specific checked exception. Never let pass the original NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBounds, etc in this case!\n\nThere are at least three very good reasons against the case of mapping all kinds of argument constraint violations to IllegalArgumentException, with the third probably being so severe as to mark the practice bad style:\n(1) A programmer cannot a safely assume that all cases of argument constraint violations result in IllegalArgumentException, because the large majority of standard classes use this exception rather as a wastebasket if there is no more specific kind of exception available. Trying to map all cases of argument constraint violations to IllegalArgumentException in your API only leads to programmer frustration using your classes, as the standard libraries mostly follow different rules that violate yours, and most of your API users will use them as well!\n(2) Mapping the exceptions actually results in a different kind of anomaly, caused by single inheritance: All Java exceptions are classes, and therefore support single inheritance only. Therefore, there is no way to create an exception that is truly say both a NullPointerException and an IllegalArgumentException, as subclasses can only inherit from one or the other. Throwing an IllegalArgumentException in case of a null argument therefore makes it harder for API users to distinguish between problems whenever a program tries to programmatically correct the problem, for example by feeding default values into a call repeat!\n(3) Mapping actually creates the danger of bug masking: In order to map argument constraint violations into IllegalArgumentException, you\'ll need to code an outer try-catch within every method that has any constrained arguments. However, simply catching RuntimeException in this catch block is out of the question, because that risks mapping documented RuntimeExceptions thrown by libery methods used within yours into IllegalArgumentException, even if they are no caused by argument constraint violations. So you need to be very specific, but even that effort doesn\'t protect you from the case that you accidentally map an undocumented runtime exception of another API (i.e. a bug) into an IllegalArgumentException of your API. Even the most careful mapping therefore risks masking programming errors of other library makers as argument constraint violations of your method\'s users, which is simply hillareous behavior!\nWith the standard practice on the other hand, the rules stay simple, and exception causes stay unmasked and specific. For the method caller, the rules are easy as well:\n- if you encounter a documented runtime exception of any kind because you passed an illegal value, either repeat the call with a default (for this specific exceptions are neccessary), or correct your code\n- if on the other hand you enccounter a runtime exception that is not documented to happen for a given set of arguments, file a bug report to the method\'s makers to ensure that either their code or their documentation is fixed.\n', 'questionId': '3881', 'answerId': '14104551'}

{'answer': u'Java Reflection makes it possible to inspect classes, interfaces, fields and methods at runtime, without knowing the names of the classes, methods etc. at compile time.

The equivalent byte code is suppose B1. If suppose you have 1000 methods named add in your system. Now you want to check the value of parameter a and b before method add is called. So, you can glue your code to another program or framework that uses reflection to dynamically examine the byte code value using Object.getClass.getMethod(). There are several classes for examining. It can add more operation before method add is called. But, the program itself or another program or framework does not know about the object that has a method named add.

But what would be wrong in letting the "closure [java a.i.c.]" just get a copy of the reference as if passed via a constructor (well that in fact is how it is done).\nIf the closure wants to overwrite the reference, so be it; it will do so without changing the copy that the enclosing scope sees.\nIf we argue that that would lead to unreadable code (e.g. maybe it\'s not straight-forward to see what the object reference is at the time of the constructor call for the a.i.c.), then how about at least making the syntax less verbose?

{'answer': u"The CLR and JVM have goals and philosophies that differ more than you might think. In general, the JVM aims to optimize more dynamic, higher-level code while the CLR gives you more low-level tools to do these kinds of optimizations yourself. \nA good example is stack allocation. On the CLR you have explicit stack allocation of custom value types. On the JVM the only custom types are reference types but the JVM can convert heap allocations to stack allocations in certain circumstances through Escape Analysis.\nAnother example. In Java, methods are virtual by default. On C# at least, they are not. It is much more difficult to optimize virtual method calls because the code that gets executed at a given call site cannot be determined statically.\nUnder the hood, their execution systems are quite different. Most JVMs (in particular, Hotspot) start out with a bytecode interpreter and only JIT-compile parts of the code that are executed heavily e.g. tight loops. They can also re-compile these over and over each time using execution statistics collected from previous runs to drive optimizations. This allows more optimization effort to be applied to the parts of the program that need it most. This is called adaptive optimization.\nThe CLR compiles everything up-front only once. It does fewer optimization both because it has more code to compile and so has to be fast and because it doesn't have any statistics of the actual execution paths taken to feed into its optimizations. This approach does have the very significant advantage of allowing you to cache compilation results across processes, which CLR does but JVM does not.\nA large percentage of the Hotspot JVM code is dedicated to these adaptive optimizations and they are what put Java in the same performance ballpark as native code for most general purpose computation in the early 2000s. They are also what makes the JVM a decent target for dynamic languages. I'm excluding here the more recent developments of the Dynamic Languages Runtime and invokedynamic as I don't know enough about the DLR.\n", 'questionId': '59175', 'answerId': '15861994'}

{'answer': u'The Java Language Specification does not guarantee that the JVM will start a GC when you call System.gc(). This is the reason of this "may or may not decide to do a GC at that point".\nNow, if you look at OpenJDK source code, which is the backbone of Oracle JVM, you will see that a call to System.gc() does start a GC cycle. If you use another JVM, such as J9, you have to check their documentation to find out the answer. For instance, Azul\'s JVM has a garbage collector that runs continuously, so a call to System.gc() won\'t do anything\nSome other answer mention starting a GC in JConsole or VisualVM. Basically, these tools make a remote call to System.gc().\nUsually, you don\'t want to start a garbage collection cycle from your code, as it messes up with the semantics of your application. Your application does some business stuff, the JVM takes care of memory management. You should keep those concerns separated (don\'t make your application do some memory management, focus on business).\nHowever, there are few cases where a call to System.gc() might be understandable. Consider, for example, microbenchmarks. No-one wants to have a GC cycle to happen in the middle of a microbenchmark. So you may trigger a GC cycle between each measurement to make sure every measurement starts with an empty heap.\n', 'questionId': '66540', 'answerId': '16496206'}

{'answer': u"Your question seems two folded to me. On one had you would like to compare two test frameworks, on the other hand you would like to implement tests easily, have natural assertions, etc...\nOk, firstly JUnit has been playing catchup with TestNG in terms of functionality, they have bridged the gap some what with v4, but not well enough in my opinion. Things like annotations and dataproviders are still much better in TestNG. Also they are more flexible in terms of test execution, since TestNG has test dependency, grouping and ordering.\nJUnit still requires certain before/after methods to be static, which limits what you can do prior to the running of tests, TestNG never has this issue.\nTBH, mostly the differences between the two frameworks don't mean much, unless your focusing on integration/automation testing. JUnit from my experience is built from the ground up for unit testing and is now being pushed towards higher levels of testing, which IMO makes it the wrong tool for the job. TestNG does well at unit testing and due to its robust dataproviding and great test execution abilities, works even better at integration/automation test level.\nNow for what I believe is a separate issue, how to write well structured, readable and maintainable tests. Most of this I am sure you know, but things like Factory Pattern, Command Pattern and PageObjects (if your testing websites) are vital, it is very important to have a layer of abstraction between what your testing (SUT) and what the actual test is (assertions of business logic). In order to have much nicer assertions, you can use Hamcrest.

When A releases the monitor, B and C will still be sitting there, waiting for a notify().\nIf you used notifyAll(), then B and C have both advanced past the "wait for notification" state and are both waiting to acquire the monitor.

{'answer': u"In an attempt to add even more to this, I thought I'd include the SCJP Study Guide section on the topic. This is from the guide that is made to pass the Sun/Oracle test on the behaviour of Java so it's a good source to use for this discussion.\n\nPassing Variables into Methods (Objective 7.3)\n7.3 Determine the effect upon object references and primitive values when they are passed into methods that perform assignments or other modifying operations on the parameters.\nMethods can be declared to take primitives and/or object references. You need to know how (or if) the caller's variable can be affected by the called method. The difference between object reference and primitive variables, when passed into methods, is huge and important. To understand this section, you'll need to be comfortable with the assignments section covered in the first part of this chapter.\nPassing Object Reference Variables\nWhen you pass an object variable into a method, you must keep in mind that you're passing the object reference, and not the actual object itself. Remember that a reference variable holds bits that represent (to the underlying VM) a way to get to a specific object in memory (on the heap). More importantly, you must remember that you aren't even passing the actual reference variable, but rather a copy of the reference variable. A copy of a variable means you get a copy of the bits in that variable, so when you pass a reference variable, you're passing a copy of the bits representing how to get to a specific object. In other words, both the caller and the called method will now have identical copies of the reference, and thus both will refer to the same exact (not a copy) object on the heap.\nFor this example, we'll use the Dimension class from the java.awt package:\n\n\n\nWhen we run this class, we can see that the modify() method was indeed able to modify the original (and only) Dimension object created on line 4.\n\n\n\nNotice when the Dimension object on line 4 is passed to the modify() method, any changes to the object that occur inside the method are being made to the object whose reference was passed. In the preceding example, reference variables d and dim both point to the same object.\nDoes Java Use Pass-By-Value Semantics?\nIf Java passes objects by passing the reference variable instead, does that mean Java uses pass-by-reference for objects? Not exactly, although you'll often hear and read that it does. Java is actually pass-by-value for all variables running within a single VM. Pass-by-value means pass-by-variable-value. And that means, pass-by-copy-of- the-variable! (There's that word copy again!)\nIt makes no difference if you're passing primitive or reference variables, you are always passing a copy of the bits in the variable. So for a primitive variable, you're passing a copy of the bits representing the value. For example, if you pass an int variable with the value of 3, you're passing a copy of the bits representing 3. The called method then gets its own copy of the value, to do with it what it likes.\nAnd if you're passing an object reference variable, you're passing a copy of the bits representing the reference to an object. The called method then gets its own copy of the reference variable, to do with it what it likes. But because two identical reference variables refer to the exact same object, if the called method modifies the object (by invoking setter methods, for example), the caller will see that the object the caller's original variable refers to has also been changed. In the next section, we'll look at how the picture changes when we're talking about primitives.\nThe bottom line on pass-by-value: the called method can't change the caller's variable, although for object reference variables, the called method can change the object the variable referred to. What's the difference between changing the variable and changing the object? For object references, it means the called method can't reassign the caller's original reference variable and make it refer to a different object, or null. For example, in the following code fragment,\n\n\n\nreassigning g does not reassign f! At the end of the bar() method, two Foo objects have been created, one referenced by the local variable f and one referenced by\n  the local (argument) variable g. Because the doStuff() method has a copy of the reference variable, it has a way to get to the original Foo object, for instance to call the setName() method. But, the doStuff() method does not have a way to get to the f reference variable. So doStuff() can change values within the object f refers to, but doStuff() can't change the actual contents (bit pattern) of f. In other words, doStuff() can change the state of the object that f refers to, but it can't make f refer to a different object!\nPassing Primitive Variables\nLet's look at what happens when a primitive variable is passed to a method:\n\n\n\nIn this simple program, the variable a is passed to a method called modify(),\n  which increments the variable by 1. The resulting output looks like this:\n\n\n\nNotice that a did not change after it was passed to the method. Remember, it was a copy of a that was passed to the method. When a primitive variable is passed to a method, it is passed by value, which means pass-by-copy-of-the-bits-in-the-variable.\n\n", 'questionId': '40480', 'answerId': '17303467'}

{'answer': u'The interface segregation is the \u201cI\u201d on the SOLID principle, before digging too deep with the first, let\u2019s explain what\u2019s does the latter mean. \nSOLID can be considered a set of best practices and recommendations made by experts (meaning they have  been proved before) in order to provide a reliable foundation in how we design applications. These practices strive to  make easier to maintain, extend, adapt and scale our applications.\nWhy should I care about SOLID programming?\nFirst of all, you have to realize you are not going to be forever where you are. If we use standards and well known architectures, we can be sure that our code will be easy to maintain by other developers that come after us, and I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t want to deal with the task of fixing a code that didn\u2019t applied any known methodology as it would be very hard to understand it.\nThe interface segregation principle.\nKnow that we know what the SOLID principles are we can get into more detail about the Interface Segregation principle, but what exactly does the interface segregation says?\n\n\u201cClients should not be forced to implement unnecessary methods which\n  they will not use\u201d\n\nThis means that sometimes we tend to make interfaces with a lot of methods, which can be good to an extent, however this can easily abused, and we can end up with classes that implement empty or useless methods which of course adds extra code and burden to our apps.\nImagine you are declaring a lot of methods in single interface, if you like visual aids a class that is implementing an interface but that is really needing a couple of methods of it would look like this:\n\nIn the other hand, if you properly apply the interface segregation and split your interface in smaller subsets you can me sure to implement those that are only needed:\n\nSee! Is way better!  Enforcing this principle will allow you to have low coupling which aids to  a better maintainability and high  resistance to changes. So you can really leverage the usage of interfaces and implementing the methods when you really should.\nNow let\u2019s review a less abstract example, say you declared an interface called Reportable\n\nAnd you have a client that will only to export some data in Excel format, you can implement the interface, but would you only have to implement the excel method? The answer is no, you will have to code the implementation for all the methods even if you are not going to use them, this can cause a lot of junk code hence making the code hard to maintain..\nRemember keep it simple and don\u2019t repeat yourself and you will find that you are already using this principle without knowing.\n', 'questionId': '58988', 'answerId': '17999321'}

{'answer': u"The bottom line on pass-by-value: the called method can't change the caller's\nvariable, although for object reference variables, the called method can change the\nobject the variable referred to.

In the code below, \nreassigning g does not reassign f! At the end of the bar() method, two Foo objects\nhave been created, one referenced by the local variable f and one referenced by\nthe local (argument) variable g. \nBecause the doStuff() method has a copy of the reference variable, it has a way to get \nto the original Foo object, for instance to call\nthe setName() method.

{'answer': u'I feel like arguing about "pass-by-reference vs pass-by-value" is not super-helpful.\nIf you say, "Java is pass by whatever (reference/value)", but in either case you\'re not provide a complete answer. Here\'s some additional information that will hopefully aid in understanding what\'s happening in memory.\nCrash course on stack/heap before we get to the Java implementation:\nValues go on and off the stack in a nice orderly fashion, like a stack of plates at a cafeteria.\nMemory in the heap (also known as dynamic memory) is haphazard and disorganized. The JVM just finds space wherever it can, and frees it up as the variables that use it are no longer needed.\nOkay. First off, local primitives go on the stack. So this code:\n\nresults in this:\n\nWhen you declare and instantiate an object. The actual object goes on the heap. What goes on the stack? The address of the object on the heap. C++ programmers would call this a pointer, but some Java developers are racist against the word "pointer". Whatever. Just know that the address of the object goes in the stack.\nLike so:\n\n\nAn array is an object, so it goes on the heap as well. And what about the objects in the array? They get their own heap space, and the address of each object goes inside the array.\n\n\nSo, what gets passed in when you call a method? If you pass in an object, what you\'re actually passing in is the address of the object. Some might say the "value" of the address, and some say it\'s just a reference to the object. This is the genesis of the holy war between "reference" and "value" proponents. What you call it isn\'t as important as that you understand that what\'s getting passed in is the address to the object.\n\nOne String gets created and space for it is allocated in the heap, and the address to the string is stored on the stack and given the identifier hisName, since the address of the second String is the same as the first, no new String is created and no new heap space is allocated, but a new identifier is created on the stack. Then we call shout(): a new stack frame is created and a new identifier, name is created and assigned the address of the already-existing String.\n\nSo, value, reference? You say "potato".\n', 'questionId': '40480', 'answerId': '18740042'}

If a user attempts to read from an non-existing file, the caller can prompt them for a new filename. On the other hand, if the method fails due to a programming bug (invalid method arguments or buggy method implementation) there is nothing the application can do to fix the problem in mid-execution. The best it can do is log the problem and wait for the developer to fix it at a later time.\n\nUnless the exception you are throwing meets all of the above conditions it should use an Unchecked Exception.\nReevaluate at every level: Sometimes the method catching the checked exception isn't the right place to handle the error. In that case, consider what is reasonable for your own callers. If the exception is expected, unpreventable and reasonable for them to recover from then you should throw a checked exception yourself. If not, you should wrap the exception in an unchecked exception. If you follow this rule you will find yourself converting checked exceptions to unchecked exceptions and vice versa depending on what layer you are in.\nFor both checked and unchecked exceptions, use the right abstraction level. For example, a code repository with two different implementations (database and filesystem) should avoid exposing implementation-specific details by throwing SQLException or IOException. Instead, it should wrap the exception in an abstraction that spans all implementations (e.g. RepositoryException).\n", 'questionId': '27578', 'answerId': '19061110'}

{'answer': u'A reference is always a value when represented, no matter what language you use.\nGetting an outside of the box view, let\'s look at Assembly or some low level memory management. At the CPU level a reference to anything immediately becomes a value if it gets written to memory or to one of the CPU registers. (That is why pointer is a good definition. It is a value, which has a purpose at the same time).\nData in memory has a Location and at that location there is a value (byte,word, whatever). In Assembly we have a convenient solution to give a Name to certain Location (aka variable), but when compiling the code, the assembler simply replaces Name with the designated location just like your browser replaces domain names with IP addresses.\nDown to the core it is technically impossible to pass a reference to anything in any language without representing it (when it immediately becomes a value).\nLets say we have a variable Foo, its Location is at the 47th byte in memory and its Value is 5. We have another variable Ref2Foo which is at 223rd byte in memory, and its value will be 47. This Ref2Foo might be a technical variable, not explicitly created by the program. If you just look at 5 and 47 without any other information, you will see just two Values.\nIf you use them as references then to reach to 5 we have to travel:\n\nThis is how jump-tables work. \nIf we want to call a method/function/procedure with Foo\'s value, there are a few possible way to pass the variable to the method, depending on the language and its several method invocation modes:\n\n5 gets copied to one of the CPU registers (ie. EAX).\n5 gets PUSHd to the stack.\n47 gets copied to one of the CPU registers\n47 PUSHd to the stack.\n223 gets copied to one of the CPU registers.\n223 gets PUSHd to the stack.\n\nIn every cases above a value - a copy of an existing value - has been created, it is now upto the receiving method to handle it. When you write "Foo" inside the method, it is either read out from EAX, or automatically  dereferenced, or double dereferenced, the process depends on how the language works and/or what the type of Foo dictates. This is hidden from the developer until she circumvents the dereferencing process. So a reference is a value when represented, because a reference is a value that has to be processed (at language level).\nNow we have passed Foo to the method:\n\nin case 1. and 2. if you change Foo (Foo = 9) it only affects local scope as you have a copy of the Value. From inside the method we cannot even determine where in memory the original Foo was located.\nin case 3. and 4. if you use default language constructs and change Foo (Foo = 11), it could change Foo globally (depends on the language, ie. Java or like Pascal\'s procedure findMin(x, y, z: integer;var m: integer);). However if the language allows you to circumvent the dereference process, you can change 47, say to 49. At that point Foo seems to have been changed if you read it, because you have changed the local pointer to it. And if you were to modify this Foo inside the method (Foo = 12) you will probably FUBAR the execution of the program (aka. segfault) because you will write to a different memory than expected, you can even modify an area that is destined to hold executable program and writing to it will modify running code (Foo is now not at 47). BUT Foo\'s value of 47 did not change globally, only the one inside the method, because 47 was also a copy to the method.\nin case 5. and 6. if you modify 223 inside the method it creates the same mayhem as in 3. or 4. (a pointer, pointing to a now bad value, that is again used as a pointer) but this is still a local problem, as 223 was copied. However if you are able to dereference Ref2Foo (that is 223), reach to and modify the pointed value 47, say, to 49, it will affect Foo globally, because in this case the methods got a copy of 223  but the referenced 47 exists only once, and changing that to 49 will lead every Ref2Foo double-dereferencing to a wrong value.\n\nNitpicking on insignificant details, even languages that do pass-by-reference will pass values to functions, but those functions know that they have to use it for dereferencing purposes. This pass-the-reference-as-value is just hidden from the programmer because it is practically useless and the terminology is only pass-by-reference.\nStrict pass-by-value is also useless, it would mean that a 100 Mbyte array should have to be copied every time we call a method with the array as argument, therefore Java cannot be stricly pass-by-value. Every language would pass a reference to this huge array (as a value) and either employs copy-on-write mechanism if that array can be changed locally inside the method or allows the method (as Java does) to modify the array globally (from the caller\'s view) and a few languages allows to modify the Value of the reference itself.\nSo in short and in Java\'s own terminology, Java is pass-by-value where value can be: either a real value or a value that is a representation of a reference. \n', 'questionId': '40480', 'answerId': '20566453'}

{'answer': u'One must understand the Garbage Collector(GC) Workflow to understand the function of finalize. calling .finalize() will not invoke the garbage collector, nor calling system.gc. Actually, What finalize will help the coder is to declare the reference of the object as "unreferenced".\nGC forces a suspension on the running operation of JVM, which creates a dent on the performance. During operation, GC will traverse all referenced objects, starting from the root object(your main method call). This suspension time can be decreased by declaring the objects as unreferenced manually, because it will cut down the operation costs to declare the object reference obsolete by the automated run. By declaring finalize(), coder sets the reference to the object obsolete, thus on the next run of GC operation, GC run will sweep the objects without using operation time.\nQuote: "After the finalize method has been invoked for an object, no further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, including possible actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized, at which point the object may be discarded.

{'answer': u'Here is a very simple solution to your Checked/Unchecked dilemma.\nRule 1: Think of a Unchecked Exception as a testable condition before code executes.\nfor example\u2026\n\nwhere x is null...\n\u2026the code should possibly have the following\u2026\n\nRule 2: Think of a Checked Exception as an un-testable condition that may occur while the code executes.\n\n\u2026in the example above, the URL (google.com) may be unavailable to due the DNS server being down. Even at the instant the DNS server was working and resolved the \u2018google.com\u2019 name to an IP address, if the connection is made to google.com, at anytime afterword, the network could go down. You simply can not test the network all the time before reading and writing to streams.\nThere are times where the code simply must execute before we can know if there is a problem. By forcing developers to write their code in such a way to force them to handle these situations via Checked Exception, I have to tip my hat to the creator of Java that invented this concept.\nIn general, almost all the APIs in Java follow the 2 rules above. If you try to write to a file, the disk could fill up before completing the write. It is possible that other processes had caused the disk to become full. There is simply no way to test for this situation. For those who interact with hardware where at any time, using the hardware can fail, Checked Exceptions seem to be an elegant solution to this problem.\nThere is a gray area to this. In the event that many tests are needed (a mind blowing if statement with lots of && and ||), the exception thrown will be a CheckedException simply because it\u2019s too much of a pain to get right \u2014 you simply can\u2019t say this problem is a programming error. If there are much less than 10 tests (e.g. \u2018if (x == null)\u2019), then the programmer error should be a UncheckedException.\nThings get interesting when dealing with language interpreters. According to the rules above, should a Syntax Error be considered a Checked or Unchecked Exception? I would argue that if the syntax of the language can be tested before it gets executed, it should be an UncheckedException. If the language can not be tested \u2014 similar to how assembly code runs on a personal computer, then the Syntax Error should be a Checked Exception.\nThe 2 rules above will probably remove 90% of your concern over which to choose from. To summarize the rules, follow this pattern\u2026\n1) if the code to be execute can be tested before it\u2019s executed for it to run correctly and if an Exception occurs \u2014 a.k.a. a programmer error, the Exception should be an UncheckedException (a subclass of RuntimeException).\n2) if the code to be executed can not be tested before it\u2019s executed for it to run correctly, the Exception should be a Checked Exception (a subclass of Exception).\n', 'questionId': '27578', 'answerId': '23439719'}
{'answer': u'A private method is only to be accessed within the same class. So there is no way to test a \u201cprivate\u201d method of a target class from any test class.

{'answer': u'I hope this will clear some doubts.\nnotify() : The notify() method wakes up one thread waiting\nfor the lock (the first thread that called wait() on that lock).\nnotifyAll() : The notifyAll() method wakes up all the threads waiting for the lock; the JVM selects one of the threads from the list of threads waiting for the lock and wakes\nthat thread up.\nIn the case of a single thread waiting for a lock, there is no significant difference between notify() and notifyAll(). However, when there is more than one thread waiting for the lock, in both notify() and notifyAll(), the exact thread woken up is under the control of the JVM and you cannot programmatically control waking up a specific thread.\nAt first glance, it appears that it is a good idea to just call notify() to wake up one thread; it might seem unnecessary to wake up all the threads. However, the problem with notify() is that the thread woken up might not be the suitable one to be woken up (the thread might be waiting for some other condition, or the condition is still not satisfied for that thread etc). In that case, the notify() might be lost and no other thread will wake up potentially leading to a type of deadlock (the notification is lost and all other threads are waiting for notification\u2014forever).\nTo avoid this problem, it is always better to call notifyAll() when there is more than one thread waiting for a lock (or more than one condition on which waiting is done). The notifyAll() method wakes up all threads, so it is not very efficient. however, this performance loss is negligible in real world applications.\n', 'questionId': '37026', 'answerId': '23927058'}

{'answer': u"I thought I'd contribute this answer to add more details from the Specifications.\nFirst, What's the difference between passing by reference vs. passing by value?\n\nPassing by reference means the called functions' parameter will be the\n  same as the callers' passed argument (not the value, but the identity\n  - the variable itself). \nPass by value means the called functions' parameter will be a copy of\n  the callers' passed argument.\n\nOr from wikipedia, on the subject of pass-by-reference\n\nIn call-by-reference evaluation (also referred to as\n  pass-by-reference), a function receives an implicit reference to a\n  variable used as argument, rather than a copy of its value. This\n  typically means that the function can modify (i.e. assign to) the\n  variable used as argument\u2014something that will be seen by its caller.\n\nAnd on the subject of pass-by-value\n\nIn call-by-value, the argument expression is evaluated, and the\n  resulting value is bound to the corresponding variable in the function [...]. \n  If the function or procedure is able to assign values to its\n  parameters, only its local copy is assigned [...].\n\nSecond, we need to know what Java uses in its method invocations. The Java Language Specification states\n\nWhen the method or constructor is invoked (\xa715.12), the values of the\n  actual argument expressions initialize newly created parameter\n  variables, each of the declared type, before execution of the body of\n  the method or constructor.\n\nSo it assigns (or binds) the value of the argument to the corresponding parameter variable. \nWhat is the value of the argument?\nLet's consider reference types, the Java Virtual Machine Specification states\n\nThere are three kinds of reference types: class types, array types,\n  and interface types. Their values are references to dynamically\n  created class instances, arrays, or class instances or arrays that\n  implement interfaces, respectively.\n\nThe Java Language Specification also states\n\nThe reference values (often just references) are pointers to these objects, and a special null reference, which refers to no object.\n\nThe value of an argument (of some reference type) is a pointer to an object. Note that a variable, an invocation of a method with a reference type return type, and an instance creation expression (new ...) all resolve to a reference type value.\nSo\n\nall bind the value of a reference to a String instance to the method's newly created parameter, param. This is exactly what the definition of pass-by-value describes. As such, Java is pass-by-value.\nThe fact that you can follow the reference to invoke a method or access a field of the referenced object is completely irrelevant to the conversation. The definition of pass-by-reference was\n\nThis typically means that the function can modify (i.e. assign to) the\n  variable used as argument\u2014something that will be seen by its caller.\n\nIn Java, modifying the variable means reassigning it. In Java, if you reassigned the variable within the method, it would go unnoticed to the caller. Modifying the object referenced by the variable is a different concept entirely. \n\nPrimitive values are also defined in the Java Virtual Machine Specification, here. The value of the type is the corresponding integral or floating point value, encoded appropriately (8, 16, 32, 64, etc. bits).\n", 'questionId': '40480', 'answerId': '24546764'}

{'answer': u"In both languages (Java and C#) int is 4-byte signed integer.\nUnlike Java, C# Provides both signed and unsigned integer values. As Java and C# are object object-oriented, some operations in these languages do not map directly onto instructions provided by the run time and so needs to be defined as part of an object of some type.\nC# provides System.Int32 which is a value type using a part of  memory that belongs to the reference type on the heap.\njava provides java.lang.Integer which is a reference type operating on int. The methods in Integer can't be compiled directly to run time instructions.So we box an int value to convert it into an instance of Integer and use the methods which expects instance of some type (like toString(), parseInt(), valueOf() etc).\nIn C# variable  int refers to System.Int32.Any 4-byte value in memory can be interpreted as a primitive int, that can be manipulated by  instance of System.Int32.So int is an alias for System.Int32.When using integer-related methods like int.Parse(), int.ToString() etc. Integer is compiled into the FCL System.Int32 struct calling the respective methods like Int32.Parse(), Int32.ToString().\n", 'questionId': '564', 'answerId': '24795920'}

{'answer': u'Old and classic topic, just want to add this helpful blog that explains this:\nhttp://blog.manishchhabra.com/2012/08/the-5-main-differences-betwen-hashmap-and-hashtable/\nBlog by Manish Chhabra\n\nThe 5 main differences betwen HashMap and Hashtable\nHashMap and Hashtable both implement java.util.Map interface but there\n  are some differences that Java developers must understand to write\n  more efficient code. As of the Java 2 platform v1.2, Hashtable class\n  was retrofitted to implement the Map interface, making it a member of\n  the Java Collections Framework.\n\nOne of the major differences between HashMap and Hashtable is that HashMap is non-synchronized whereas Hashtable is synchronized, which\n  means Hashtable is thread-safe and can be shared between multiple\n  threads but HashMap cannot be shared between multiple threads without\n  proper synchronization. Java 5 introduced ConcurrentHashMap which is\n  an alternative of Hashtable and provides better scalability than\n  Hashtable in Java.Synchronized means only one thread can modify a hash\n  table at one point of time. Basically, it means that any thread before\n  performing an update on a hashtable will have to acquire a lock on the\n  object while others will wait for lock to be released.\nThe HashMap class is roughly equivalent to Hashtable, except that it permits nulls. (HashMap allows null values as key and value whereas\n  Hashtable doesn\u2019t allow nulls).\nThe third significant difference between HashMap vs Hashtable is that Iterator in the HashMap is a fail-fast iterator while the\n  enumerator for the Hashtable is not and throw\n  ConcurrentModificationException if any other Thread modifies the map\n  structurally by adding or removing any element except Iterator\u2019s own\n  remove() method. But this is not a guaranteed behavior and will be\n  done by JVM on best effort. This is also an important difference\n  between Enumeration and Iterator in Java.\nOne more notable difference between Hashtable and HashMap is that because of thread-safety and synchronization Hashtable is much slower\n  than HashMap if used in Single threaded environment. So if you don\u2019t\n  need synchronization and HashMap is only used by one thread, it out\n  perform Hashtable in Java.\nHashMap does not guarantee that the order of the map will remain constant over time.\n\nNote that HashMap can be synchronized by\n\nIn Summary there are significant differences between Hashtable and\n  HashMap in Java e.g. thread-safety and speed and based upon that only\n  use Hashtable if you absolutely need thread-safety, if you are running\n  Java 5 consider using ConcurrentHashMap in Java.\n\n', 'questionId': '40471', 'answerId': '25348157'}

But there are certain behaviors that can make you think you\'re passing by reference.\n\nPassing by copy: When a variable is passed to a method/function, a copy is made (sometimes we hear that when you pass primitives, you\'re making copies).\nPassing by reference: When a variable is passed to a method/function, the code in the method/function operates on the original variable (You\'re still passing by copy, but references to values inside the complex object are parts of both versions of the variable, both the original and the version inside the function. The complex objects themselves are being copied, but the internal references are being retained)\n\nExamples of Passing by copy/ by value\nExample from [ref 1]\n\nExample from [ref 2]\n\nshows nicely the mechanism\n  watch max 5 min\n\n(Passing by reference) pass-by-copy-of-the-variable-value\nExample from [ref 1]\n(remember that an array is an object)\n\nThe complex objects themselves are being copied, but the internal references are being retained.\nExample from[ref 3]\n\nThe area of the rectangle is 200 and the length=10 and width=20\nLast thing I would like to share was this moment of the lecture:\nMemory Allocation\nwhich I found very helpful in understanding the Java passing by value or rather \u201cpass-by-copy-of-the-variable-value\u201d as @Gevorg has written.\n\nREF 1 Lynda.com\nREF 2 Professor Mehran Sahami\n\nwatch max 5 min\nMemory Allocation\n\nREF 3 c4learn\n\npassing-object-as-parameter-to-method\n\n\n', 'questionId': '40480', 'answerId': '26028582'}

{'answer': u'Uses of Reflection\nReflection is commonly used by programs which require the ability to examine or modify the runtime behavior of applications running in the Java virtual machine. This is a relatively advanced feature and should be used only by developers who have a strong grasp of the fundamentals of the language. With that caveat in mind, reflection is a powerful technique and can enable applications to perform operations which would otherwise be impossible.\nExtensibility Features\nAn application may make use of external, user-defined classes by creating instances of extensibility objects using their fully-qualified names.\nClass Browsers and Visual Development Environments\nA class browser needs to be able to enumerate the members of classes. Visual development environments can benefit from making use of type information available in reflection to aid the developer in writing correct code.\nDebuggers and Test Tools\nDebuggers need to be able to examine private members on classes. Test harnesses can make use of reflection to systematically call a discoverable set APIs defined on a class, to insure a high level of code coverage in a test suite.\nDrawbacks of Reflection\nReflection is powerful, but should not be used indiscriminately. If it is possible to perform an operation without using reflection, then it is preferable to avoid using it. The following concerns should be kept in mind when accessing code via reflection.\n\nPerformance Overhead\n\nBecause reflection involves types that are dynamically resolved, certain Java virtual machine optimizations can not be performed. Consequently, reflective operations have slower performance than their non-reflective counterparts, and should be avoided in sections of code which are called frequently in performance-sensitive applications.\n\nSecurity Restrictions\n\nReflection requires a runtime permission which may not be present when running under a security manager. This is in an important consideration for code which has to run in a restricted security context, such as in an Applet.\n\nExposure of Internals\n\nSince reflection allows code to perform operations that would be illegal in non-reflective code, such as accessing private fields and methods, the use of reflection can result in unexpected side-effects, which may render code dysfunctional and may destroy portability. Reflective code breaks abstractions and therefore may change behavior with upgrades of the platform.\nsource: The Reflection API\n', 'questionId': '37628', 'answerId': '26424561'}

{'answer': u'You should use jol, a tool developed as part of the OpenJDK project.\n\nJOL (Java Object Layout) is the tiny toolbox to analyze object layout schemes in JVMs. These tools are using Unsafe, JVMTI, and Serviceability Agent (SA) heavily to decoder the actual object layout, footprint, and references. This makes JOL much more accurate than other tools relying on heap dumps, specification assumptions, etc.\n\nTo get the sizes of primitives, references and array elements, use VMSupport.vmDetails().  On Oracle JDK 1.8.0_40 running on 64-bit Windows (used for all following examples), this method returns\n\nYou can get the shallow size of an object instance using ClassLayout.parseClass(Foo.class).toPrintable() (optionally passing an instance to toPrintable).  This is only the space consumed by a single instance of that class; it does not include any other objects referenced by that class.  It does include VM overhead for the object header, field alignment and padding.  For java.util.regex.Pattern:\n\nYou can get a summary view of the deep size of an object instance using GraphLayout.parseInstance(obj).toFootprint().  Of course, some objects in the footprint might be shared (also referenced from other objects), so it is an overapproximation of the space that could be reclaimed when that object is garbage collected.  For the result of Pattern.compile("^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\\\\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$") (taken from this answer), jol reports a total footprint of 1840 bytes, of which only 72 are the Pattern instance itself.\n\nIf you instead use GraphLayout.parseInstance(obj).toPrintable(), jol will tell you the address, size, type, value and path of field dereferences to each referenced object, though that\'s usually too much detail to be useful.  For the ongoing pattern example, you might get the following.  (Addresses will likely change between runs.)\n\nThe "(something else)" entries describe other objects in the heap that are not part of this object graph.\nThe best jol documentation is the jol samples in the jol repository.  The samples demonstrate common jol operations and show how you can use jol to analyze VM and garbage collector internals.\n', 'questionId': '52353', 'answerId': '30021105'}

{'answer': u'Difference between HashMap and HashTable / HashMap vs HashTable \n\nSynchronization or Thread Safe :  This is the most important difference between two . HashMap is non synchronized and not thread safe.On the other hand, HashTable is thread safe and synchronized.\nWhen to use HashMap ?  answer is if your application do not require any multi-threading task, in other words hashmap is better for non-threading applications. HashTable should be used in multithreading applications.\nNull keys and null values :  Hashmap allows one null key and any number of null values, while Hashtable do not allow null keys and null values in the HashTable object.\nIterating the values:  Hashmap object values are iterated by using iterator .HashTable is the only class other than vector which uses enumerator to iterate the values of HashTable object.\nFail-fast iterator  : The iterator in Hashmap is fail-fast iterator while the enumerator for Hashtable is not.\nAccording to Oracle Docs,  if the Hashtable is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created in any way except the iterator\'s own remove method , then the iterator will throw ConcurrentModification Exception.\nStructural modification means adding or removing elements from the Collection object (here hashmap or hashtable) . Thus the enumerations returned by the Hashtable keys and elements methods are not fail fast.We have already explained the difference between iterator and enumeration.\nPerformance :  Hashmap is much faster and uses less memory than Hashtable as former is unsynchronized . Unsynchronized objects are often much better in performance in compare to synchronized  object like Hashtable in single threaded environment.\nSuperclass and Legacy :  Hashtable is a subclass of Dictionary class which is now obsolete in Jdk 1.7 ,so ,it is not used anymore. It is better off externally synchronizing a HashMap or using a ConcurrentMap implementation (e.g ConcurrentHashMap).HashMap is the subclass of the AbstractMap class. Although Hashtable and HashMap has different superclasses but they both are implementations of the "Map"  abstract data type.\n\n', 'questionId': '40471', 'answerId': '30108941'}

{'answer': u'Most of the time, in enterprise applications the Java heap given is larger than the ideal size of max 12 to 16 GB. I have found it hard to make the NetBeans profiler work directly on these big java apps.\nBut usually this is not needed. You can use the jmap utility that comes with the jdk to take a "live" heap dump , that is jmap will dump the heap after running GC.  Do some operation on the application, wait till the operation is completed, then take another "live" heap dump. Use tools like Eclipse MAT to load the heapdumps, sort on the histogram, see which objects have increased, or which are the highest, This would give a clue.\n\nThere is only one problem with this approach; Huge heap dumps, even with the live option, may be too big to transfer out to development lap, and may need a machine with enough memory/RAM to open.\nThat is where the class histogram comes into picture. You can dump a live class histogram with the jmap tool. This will give only the class histogram of memory usage.Basically it won\'t have the information to chain the reference. For example it may put char array at the top. And String class somewhere below. You have to draw the connection yourself. \n\nInstead of taking two heap dumps, take two class histograms, like as described above; Then compare the class histograms and see the classes that are increasing. See if you can relate the Java classes to your application classes. This will give a pretty good hint. Here is a pythons script that can help you compare two  jmap histogram dumps. histogramparser.py\nFinally tools like JConolse and VisualVm are essential to see the memory growth over time, and see if there is a memory leak. Finally sometimes your problem may not be a memory leak , but high memory usage.For this enable GC logging;use a more advanced and new compacting GC like G1GC; and you can use jdk tools like jstat to see the GC behaviour live\n\nOther referecences to google for -jhat, jmap, Full GC, Humongous allocation, G1GC\n', 'questionId': '40119', 'answerId': '31018959'}

{'answer': u'Using UUIDs is insecure, because parts of the UUID arn\'t random at all. The procedure of @erickson is very neat, but does not create strings of the same length. The following snippet should be sufficient:\n\nWhy choosing length*5. Let\'s assume the simple case of a random string of length 1, so one random character. To get a random character containing all digits 0-9 and characters a-z, we would need a random number between 0 and 35 to get one of each character. BigInteger provides a constructor to generate a random number, uniformly distributed over the range 0 to (2^numBits - 1). Unfortunately 35 is no number which can be received by 2^numBits - 1. So we have two options: Either go with 2^5-1=31 or 2^6-1=63. If we would choose 2^6 we would get a lot of "unnecesarry" / "longer" numbers. Therefore 2^5 is the better option, even if we loose 4 characters (w-z). To now generate a string of a certain length, we can simply use a 2^(length*numBits)-1 number.

{'answer': u'Q: If I encrypt my .class files and use a custom classloader to load and decrypt them on the fly, will this prevent decompilation?\nA: The problem of preventing Java byte-code decompilation is almost as old the language itself. Despite a range of obfuscation tools available on the market, novice Java programmers continue to think of new and clever ways to protect their intellectual property. In this Java Q&A installment, I dispel some myths around an idea frequently rehashed in discussion forums.\nThe extreme ease with which Java .class files can be reconstructed into Java sources that closely resemble the originals has a lot to do with Java byte-code design goals and trade-offs. Among other things, Java byte code was designed for compactness, platform independence, network mobility, and ease of analysis by byte-code interpreters and JIT (just-in-time)/HotSpot dynamic compilers. Arguably, the compiled .class files express the programmer\'s intent so clearly they could be easier to analyze than the original source code.\nSeveral things can be done, if not to prevent decompilation completely, at least to make it more difficult. For example, as a post-compilation step you could massage the .class data to make the byte code either harder to read when decompiled or harder to decompile into valid Java code (or both). Techniques like performing extreme method name overloading work well for the former, and manipulating control flow to create control structures not possible to represent through Java syntax work well for the latter. The more successful commercial obfuscators use a mix of these and other techniques.\nUnfortunately, both approaches must actually change the code the JVM will run, and many users are afraid (rightfully so) that this transformation may add new bugs to their applications. Furthermore, method and field renaming can cause reflection calls to stop working. Changing actual class and package names can break several other Java APIs (JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface), URL providers, etc.). In addition to altered names, if the association between class byte-code offsets and source line numbers is altered, recovering the original exception stack traces could become difficult.\nThen there is the option of obfuscating the original Java source code. But fundamentally this causes a similar set of problems.\nEncrypt, not obfuscate?\nPerhaps the above has made you think, "Well, what if instead of manipulating byte code I encrypt all my classes after compilation and decrypt them on the fly inside the JVM (which can be done with a custom classloader)? Then the JVM executes my original byte code and yet there is nothing to decompile or reverse engineer, right?"\nUnfortunately, you would be wrong, both in thinking that you were the first to come up with this idea and in thinking that it actually works. And the reason has nothing to do with the strength of your encryption scheme.\n', 'questionId': '49379', 'answerId': '32651383'}

{'answer': u'All of the aggregate components in Swing--that is, components made up other components, such as JTable, JTree, or JComboBox--can be highly customized. For example, a JTable component normally displays a grid of JLabel components, but it can also display JButtons, JTextFields, or even other JTables. Getting these aggregate components to display non-default objects is the easy part, however. Making them respond properly to keyboard and mouse events is a much harder task, due to Swing\'s separation of components into "renderers" and "editors." This separation was (in my opinion) a poor design choice and only serves to complicate matters when trying to extend Swing components.\nTo see what I mean, try enhancing Swing\'s JList component so that it displays checkboxes instead of labels. According to Swing philosophy, this task requires implementing two interfaces: ListCellRenderer (for drawing the checkboxes) and CellEditor (for handling keyboard and mouse events on the checkboxes). Implementing the ListCellRenderer interface is easy enough, but the CellEditor interface can be rather clumsy and hard to understand. In this particular case, I would suggest forgetting CellEditor entirely and to handle input events directly, as shown in the following code.\n\nHere, I intercept mouse clicks from the listbox and simulate a click on the appropriate checkbox. The result is a "CheckBoxList" component that is both simpler and smaller than an equivalent component using the CellEditor interface. To use the class, simply instantiate it, then pass it an array of JCheckBox objects (or subclasses of JCheckBox objects) by calling setListData. Note that the checkboxes in this component will not respond to keypresses (i.e. the spacebar), but you could always add your own key listener if needed.\nSource: DevX.com\n', 'questionId': '19766', 'answerId': '32712019'}

{'answer': u'To summarize the excellent detailed explanations above, and in the simplest way I can think of, this is due to the limitations of the JVM built-in monitor, which 1) is acquired on the entire synchronization unit (block or object) and 2) does not discriminate about the specific condition being waited/notified on/about. \nThis means that if multiple threads are waiting on different conditions and notify() is used, the selected thread may not be the one which would make progress on the newly fulfilled condition - causing that thread (and other currently still waiting threads which would be able to fulfill the condition, etc..) not to be able to make progress, and eventually starvation or program hangup. \nIn contrast, notifyAll() enables all waiting threads to eventually re-acquire the lock and check for their respective condition, thereby eventually allowing progress to be made. \nSo notify() can be used safely only if any waiting thread is guaranteed to allow progress to be made should it be selected, which in general is satisfied when all threads within the same monitor check for only one and the same condition - a fairly rare case in real world applications. \n', 'questionId': '37026', 'answerId': '33066887'}

{'answer': u"Short summary:\nAlways prefer notifyAll() over notify() unless you have a massively parallel application where a large number of threads all do the same thing.\nExplanation:\n\nnotify() [...] wakes up a single\n  thread. Because notify() doesn't allow you to specify the thread that is\n  woken up, it is useful only in massively parallel applications \u2014 that\n  is, programs with a large number of threads, all doing similar chores.\n  In such an application, you don't care which thread gets woken up.\n\nsource: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/guardmeth.html\nCompare notify() with notifyAll() in the above described situation: a massively parallel application where threads are doing the same thing. If you call notifyAll() in that case, notifyAll() will induce the waking up (i.e. scheduling) of a huge number of threads, many of them unnecessarily (since only one thread can actually proceed, namely the thread which will be granted the monitor for the object wait(), notify(), or notifyAll() was called on), therefore wasting computing resources.\nThus, if you don't have an application where a huge number of threads do the same thing concurrently, prefer notifyAll() over notify(). Why? Because, as other users have already answered in this forum, notify() \n\nwakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's monitor. [...] The\n  choice is arbitrary and occurs at the discretion of the\n  implementation.\n\nsource: Java SE8 API (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#notify--)\nImagine you have a producer consumer application where consumers are ready (i.e. wait() ing) to consume, producers are ready (i.e. wait() ing) to produce and the queue of items (to be produced / consumed) is empty. In that case, notify() might wake up only consumers and never producers because the choice who is waken up is arbitrary. The producer consumer cycle wouldn't make any progress although producers and consumers are ready to produce and consume, respectively. Instead, a consumer is woken up (i.e. leaving the wait() status), doesn't take an item out of the queue because it's empty, and notify() s another consumer to proceed.\nIn contrast, notifyAll() awakens both producers and consumers. The choice who is scheduled depends on the scheduler. Of course, depending on the scheduler's implementation, the scheduler might also only schedule consumers (e.g. if you assign consumer threads a very high priority). However, the assumption here is that the danger of the scheduler scheduling only consumers is lower than the danger of the JVM only waking up consumers because any reasonably implemented scheduler doesn't make just arbitrary decisions. Rather, most scheduler implementations make at least some effort to prevent starvation.\n", 'questionId': '37026', 'answerId': '33329002'}

{'answer': u'What you are trying to do is not Unit Testing\nIf you test whether or not the returned objects are instances of specific concrete classes, you aren\'t unit testing. You are integration testing. While integration testing is important, it is not the same thing.\nIn unit testing, you only need to test the object itself. If you assert on the concrete type of the abstract objects returned, you are testing over the implementation of the returned object.\nUnit Testing on Objects in general\nWhen unit testing, there are four things, you want to assert:\n\nReturn values of queries (non-void methods) are what you expect them to be.\nSide-effects of commands (void methods) modify the object itself as you expect them to.\nCommands send to other objects are received (This is usually done using mocks).\n\nFurthermore, you only want to test what could be observed from an object instance, i.e. the public interface. Otherwise you tie yourself to a specific set of implementation details. This would require you to change your tests, when those details change.\nUnit Testing Factories\nUnit testing on Factories is really uninteresting, because you are not interested in the behavior of the returned objects of queries. That behavior is (hopefully) tested elswhere, presumable while unit testing that object itself. You are only really interested in whether or not the returned object has the correct type, which is guarenteed if your program compiles.\nAs Factories do not change over time (because then they would be "Builders", which is another pattern), there are no commands to test.\nFactories are responsible for instantiating objects, so they should not depend on other factories to do this for them. They might depend on a Builder, but even so, we are not supposed to test the Builder\'s correctness, only whether or not the Builder receives the message.\nThis means that all you have to test on Factories is whether or not they send the messages to the objects on which they depend. If you use Dependency Injection, this is almsot trivial. Just mock the dependencies in your unit tests, and verify that they receive the messages.\nSummary on Unit Testing Factories\n\nDo not test the behavior nor the implementation details of the returned objects! Your Factory is not responsible for the implementation of the object instances!\nTest whether or not the commands sent to dependencies are received.\n\nThat\'s it. If there are no dependencies, there is nothing to test. Except maybe to assert that the returned object isn\'t a null reference.\nIntegration Testing Factories\nIf you have a requirement that the returned abstract object type is an instance of a specific concrete type, then this falls under integration testing.\nOthers here have already answered how to do this using the instanceof operator.\n', 'questionId': '37310', 'answerId': '34199097'}
{'answer': u"NOT ALWAYS\nThe Java Language specification describes how try-catch-finally and try-catch blocks work at 14.20.2\nIn no place it specifies that the finally block is always executed.\nBut for all cases in which the try-catch-finally and try-finally blocks complete it does specify that before completion finally must be executed.\nIn other words. If NEXT is the code to be executed after the try-catch-finally or try-finally block and FIN is the code in the finally block, the JLS guarantees that FIN will always be executed before NEXT.\nWhy doesn't the JLS guarantee that the finally block is always executed after the try block? Because it is impossible. It is unlikely but possible that the JVM will be aborted (kill, crash, power off) just after completing the try block but before execution of the finally block. There is nothing the JLS can do to avoid this.\nThus, any software which for their proper behaviour depends on finally blocks always being executed after their try blocks complete are bugged.\nReturns in the try block are irrelevant to this issue. If execution reaches code after the try-catch-finally it is guaranteed that the finally block will have been executed before, with or without returns inside the try block.\n", 'questionId': '65035', 'answerId': '34240980'}

{'answer': u'A logical way to think about this is:\nCode placed in a finally block must be executed whatever occurs within the try block.\nSo if code in the try block tries to return a value or throw an exception the item is placed \u2018on the shelf\u2019 till the finally block can execute\nBecause code in the finally block has (by definition) a high priority it can return or throw whatever it likes. In which case anything left \u2018on the shelf\u2019 is discarded.\nThe only exception to this is if the VM shuts down completely during the try block e.g. by \u2018System.exit\u2019\nNever throw any exception from finally block\n\nThis is fine, as long as cleanUp() can never throw any exception. In the above example, if someMethod() throws an exception, and in the finally block also, cleanUp() throws an exception, that second exception will come out of method and the original first exception (correct reason) will be lost forever. If the code that you call in a finally block can possibly throw an exception, make sure that you either handle it, or log it. Never let it come out of the finally block.\nActually exiting the program (either by calling System.exit() or by causing a fatal error that causes the process to abort: sometimes referred to informally as a "hotspot" or "Dr Watson" in Windows) will prevent your finally block from being executed!\nThere\'s nothing to stop us nesting try/catch/finally blocks (for example, putting a try/finally block inside a try/catch block, or vice versa), and it\'s not such an uncommon thing to do.\n', 'questionId': '65035', 'answerId': '34408847'}

{'answer': u'In Java, an initializer with the declaration means the field is always initialized the same way, regardless of which constructor is used (if you have more than one) or the parameters of your constructors (if they have arguments), although a constructor might subsequently change the value (if it is not final). So using an initializer with a declaration suggests to a reader that the initialized value is the value that the field has in all cases, regardless of which constructor is used and regardless of the parameters passed to any constructor.

{'answer': u'A lot of the confusion surrounding this issue comes from the fact that Java has attempted to redefine what "Pass by value" and "Pass by reference" mean. It\'s important to understand that these are Industry Terms, and cannot be correctly understood outside of that context. They are meant to help you as you code and are valuable to understand, so let\'s first go over what they mean. \nA good description of both can be found here.\nPass By Value The value the function received is a copy of the object the caller is using. It is entirely unique to the function and anything you do to that object will only be seen within the function.\nPass By Reference The value the function received is a reference to the object the caller is using. Anything the function does to the object that value refers to will be seen by the caller and it will be working with those changes from that point on.\nAs is clear from those definitions, the fact that the reference is passed by value is irrelevant. If we were to accept that definition, then these terms become meaningless and all languages everywhere are only Pass By Value.\nNo matter how you pass the reference in, it can only ever be passed by value. That isn\'t the point. The point is that you passed a reference to your own object to the function, not a copy of it. The fact that you can throw away the reference you received is irrelevant. Again, if we accepted that definition, these terms become meaningless and everyone is always passing by value.\nAnd no, C++\'s special "pass by reference" syntax is not the exclusive definition of pass by reference. It is purely a convenience syntax meant to make it so that you don\'t need to use pointer syntax after passing the pointer in. It is still passing a pointer, the compiler is just hiding that fact from you. It also still passes that pointer BY VALUE, the compiler is just hiding that from you.\nSo, with this understanding, we can look at Java and see that it actually has both. All Java primitive types are always pass by value because you receive a copy of the caller\'s object and cannot modify their copy. All Java reference types are always pass by reference because you receive a reference to the caller\'s object and can directly modify their object. \nThe fact that you cannot modify the caller\'s reference has nothing to do with pass by reference and is true in every language that supports pass by reference.\n', 'questionId': '40480', 'answerId': '37190132'}

{'answer': u'Thinking that way is just making things sound more and more complicated. Just simply thinks that the new keyword creates a whole new object thus, when you pass an object from a variable to another variable without the keyword new, you pass the same object.\nAssume the operator = means the word "is" in English :\n\nSo, if you made any changes towards b, affects a, since b is a or you can think b as an alias for a.\nLet\'s see what happen when we change the operands into primitive variables like int, float, etc. :\n\nx is an alias for 1, whenever I say "x", it means 1. So, changes towards y will not affect x...\nAnother analogy :\nSuppose that Tommy Spade, Dennis Heart and Jackie Diamond are friends. Tommy calls Jackie "Jack" and Dennis call Jackie "Dia". Let\'s think Jack and Dia are variables. No matter what, Jackie and Dia is the same entity (object). When Tommy hit Jack\'s face, Dennis can see the bruise in Dia\'s face too of course, since Jack and Dia is the same [person].\nPrimitive values are just primitive. It has no component, just a value, so the above analogy doesn\'t work on this type of data.\nOne of the main concept of OOP is abstraction.

Instead of this:\n\nI'd have used this:\n\nThis won't be a problem even with some legacy code. Old code will be using an empty constructor, and if you ask me, refactored code will look cleaner, and you'll be able to inject necessary values in test without reflection.\nNow about private methods. In my personal experience when you have to stub a private method for testing, then that method has nothing to do in that class. A common pattern, in that case, would be to wrap it within an interface, like Callable and then you pass in that interface also in the constructor (with that multiple constructor trick):\n\nMostly all that I wrote looks like it's a dependency injection pattern. In my personal experience it's really useful while testing, and I think that this kind of code is cleaner and will be easier to maintain. I'd say the same about nested classes. If a nested class contains heavy logic it would be better if you'd moved it as a package private class and have injected it into a class needing it.\nThere are also several other design patterns which I have used while refactoring and maintaining legacy code, but it all depends on cases of your code to test. Using reflection mostly is not a problem, but when you have an enterprise application which is heavily tested and tests are run before every deployment everything gets really slow (it's just annoying and I don't like that kind of stuff).\nThere is also setter injection, but I wouldn't recommended using it.

{'answer': u'As an subjective question this should be closed, but as its still open:\nThis is part of the the internal policy used at my previous place of employment and it worked really well. This is all from memory so I can\'t remember the exact wording. Its worth noting that they did not use checked exceptions, but that is beyond the scope of the question. The unchecked exceptions they did use fell into 3 main categories.\nNullPointerException: Do not throw intentionally. NPEs are to be thrown only by the VM when dereferencing a null reference. All possible effort is to be made to ensure that these are never thrown. @Nullable and @NotNull should be used in conjunction with code analysis tools to find these errors.\nIllegalArgumentException: Thrown when an argument to a function does not conform to the public documentation, such that the error can be identified and described in terms of the arguments passed in. The OP\'s situation would fall into this category.\nIllegalStateException: Thrown when a function is called and its arguments are either unexpected at the time they are passed or incompatible with the state of the object the method is a member of.\nFor example, there were two internal versions of the IndexOutOfBoundsException used in things that had a length. One a sub-class of IllegalStateException, used if the index was larger than the length. The other a subclass of IllegalArgumentException, used if the index was negative. This was because you could add more items to the object and the argument would be valid, while a negative number is never valid.\nAs I said, this system works really well, and it took someone to explain why the distinction is there: "Depending on the type of error it is quite straight forward for you to figure out what to do. Even if you can\'t actually figure out what went wrong you can figure out where to catch that error and create additional debugging information."\nNullPointerException: Handle the Null case or put in an assertion so that the NPE is not thrown. If you put in an assertion it must one of the other two types. If possible, continue debugging as if the assertion was there in the first place.\nIllegalArgumentException: you have something wrong at your callsite. If the values being passed in are from another function, find out why you are receiving an incorrect value. If you are passing in one of your arguments propagate the error checks up the call stack until you find the function that is not returning what you expect.\nIllegalStateException: You have not called your functions in the correct order. If you are using one of your arguments, check them and throw an IllegalArgumentException describing the issue. You can then propagate the cheeks up the stack until you find the issue.\nAnyway, his point was that you can only copy the IllegalArgumentAssertions up the stack. There is no way for you to propagate the IllegalStateExceptions or NullPointerExceptions up the stack because they had something to do with your function.\n', 'questionId': '3881', 'answerId': '39658107'}

Figure 1 below shows two references pointing to the same object after Java passes an object to a method.\nJava copies and passes the\xa0reference\xa0by value, not the object.

Ideally client should not implement the methods, which are not used by the client. \nRefer to below SE question for code example:\nInterface Segregation Principle- Program to an interface\nAdvantages:\n\nFlexibility : In absence of ISP, you have one Generic FAT interface and many classes implementing it. Assume that you had 1 interface and 50 classes. If there is a change in interface, all 50 classes have to change their implementation.\nWith ISP, you will divide generic FAT interface into fine granular small interfaces. If there is a change in small granular interface, only the classes implementing that interface  will be affected.\nMaintainability and Ease of use:  Since changes are limited to fine granular interface instead of generic FACT interface, code maintenance is easier. Unrelated code is no longer part of implementation classes.\n\n', 'questionId': '58988', 'answerId': '40042398'}

{'answer': u'Java, for sure, without a doubt, is "pass by value". Also, since Java is (mostly) object-oriented and objects work with references, it\'s easy to get confused and think of it to be "pass by reference"\nPass by value means you pass the value to the method and if the method changes the passed value, the real entity doesn\'t change. Pass by reference, on the other hand, means a reference is passed to the method, and if the method changes it, the passed object also changes.\nIn Java, usually when we pass an object to a method, we basically pass the reference of the object as-a-value because that\'s how Java works; it works with references and addresses as far as Object in the heap goes.\nBut to test if it is really pass by value or pass by reference, you can use a primitive type and references:\n\nThe output is:\n\nSo in both cases, whatever happens inside the method doesn\'t change the real Object, because the value of that object was passed, and not a reference to the object itself.\nBut when you pass a custom object to a method, and the method and changes it, it will change the real object too, because even when you passed the object, you passed it\'s reference as a value to the method. Let\'s try another example:\n\nIn this case, the output is:\n\n', 'questionId': '40480', 'answerId': '41393112'}

If you are worried about the herding problem, one safe way to achieve waking one thread up at a time is to:\n1. Build an explicit waiting queue for the waiting threads;\n2.

{'answer': u'When C passes the data structure by reference, the pointer to the data structure does exist somewhere but it is immutable.

Java cannot just copy all fields of the one structure to another upon assignment.\nRegular parameter passing (without final) is kind of weird construct for C, but the closest construct could possibly be\n\nHere x is a pointer, and while you can use it to modify the structure, the pointer itself is passed by value (you can assign another value to it, this change will not propagate back to the calling code). You also need a different syntax to access the fields of the structure (*x).field or x->field, not x.field like in Java but this is just a language specific detail.\nBecause of that, C programmer that sees Java reference as a pointer would normally say this pointer has been passed by value.\n', 'questionId': '40480', 'answerId': '42134359'}

Following are the approaches we can associate the javadocs/sources with the respective jars.\n1.    If it\u2019s non-maven project :\nDownload the javadocs jar or zipped file, whatever available and placed it in some directory.\nRight click on the application project in the IDE Eclipse, click Properties and  choose Java Build Path then select tab Libraries under the Java  Build Path.  Now expand the jar you want to link with java docs/source.  Select the Javadoc location link and click on Edit button, a new window appears where we need to choose the javadocs jar path. Click OK and we have linked the javadoc/source with the respective jars.\n\n2.    If it\u2019s a maven project\nIf we are using the Maven project then  go to jar files under the Maven dependency under the project in Project Explorer view as shown below. Now right click on the jar file you want to add the Javadoc/source,  \uf0e0 choose Maven then click on Javadoc or Source you want to link with the project. Now IDE will automatically download the required javadoc/source and will link it with the respective jar in the project. \n\nYou can verify this by right click on the project in the IDE and click on Java Build Path and select the Libraries tab under the Java Build Path and then expand the desired jar, here when you click the Edit button you will see the linked path of the Javadoc/Source with the respective jar as shown below in the image.\n\n3.    If  it\u2019s Maven project and we are setting the default behavior:\nEclipse will aquatically download the javadoc/source  along with the main required jar at the starting.\nBy default setting instruction to Maven to download the Javadoc/sources for all the jars linked in the project.\nClick Windows \u2013 preferences \u2013 select Maven and click the checkbox Download Artifact Javadoc as shown below \n\nNow click on apply and save it and  now when you create new Maven project , by default the Javadocs will get downloaded and linked with all the dependent jars in the project.\nYou can verify by right click on the project and Properties and under Java Build path can see the javadocs are linked with all the jars as shown below.  \n\nIf your project is Maven project then  It\u2019s always best to use 2nd approach  because by using this approach the IDE and Maven,  takes care of downloading the correct version of the Javadoc/source and linked it with the relative jar as well.\nApproach 3rd is bit costly because the javadoc/sources will be downloaded for-all the dependent jars, may be you are not interested for javadocs/sources for all the dependent jars.\n', 'questionId': '44396', 'answerId': '43304553'}

{'answer': u"I know this question has numerous answers, but I'd like to give my little tidbit on why this wouldn't be allowed, specifically to answer why Java does not allow you to do this. So here you go...\nNow, keep in mind that super() has to be called before anything else in a subclass's constructor, so, if you did use try and catch blocks around your super() call, the blocks would have to look like this:\n\nIf super()fails in thetryblock, it HAS to be executed first in thecatchblock, so thatsuperruns before anything in your subclasss constructor. This leaves you with the same problem you had at the beginning: if an exception is thrown, it isn't caught. (In this case it just gets thrown again in the catch block.)\nNow, the above code is in no way allowed by Java either. This code may execute half of the first super call, and then call it again, which could cause some problems with some super classes.\nNow, the reason that Java doesn't let you throw an exception instead of calling super() is because the exception could be caught somewhere else, and the program would continue without calling super() on your subclass object, and possibly because the exception could take your object as a parameter and try to change the value of inherited instance variables, which would not yet have been initialized.\n", 'questionId': '5328', 'answerId': '43454831'}
{'answer': u'The Hashtable class is synchronized, that is, it is designed to be used by applications that handle multiple or multithreaded process.

It would feel silly to me to create a constructor for the exclusive purpose of initializing my lists, especially since I can initialize them in-line with the declaration.\nSo as many others have said, it depends on your usage.

{'answer': u'This is easily achievable without any external libraries.\n1. Secure Random Generation\nFirst you need a good random source. Java has SecureRandom for that typically uses the best random source on the machine.\n\nNote: SecureRandom is the slowest, but most secure way in Java of generating random bytes. I do however recommend NOT considering performance here since it usually has no real impact on your application unless you have to generate millions of tokens per second - in this case your entropy cache will probably run out.\n2. Required Space of Possible Values\nNext you have to decide "how unique" your token needs to be. The whole and only point of considering entropy is to make sure that the system can resist brute force attacks: the space of possible values must be so large that any attacker could only try a negligible proportion of the values in non-ludicrous time1. Unique identifiers such as random UUID have 122bit of entropy (ie. 2^122 = 5.3x10^36) - the chance of collision is "*(...) for there to be a one in a billion chance of duplication, 103 trillion version 4 UUIDs must be generated2". We will choose 128 bit since it fits exactly into 16 bytes and is seen as highly sufficient for being unique for basically every, but the most extreme, use cases and you don\'t have to think about duplicates. Here is a simple comparison table of entropy including simple analysis of the birthday problem.\n\nFor simple requirements 8 or 12 byte length might suffice, but with 16 bytes you are on the "safe side".\nAnd that\'s basically it. Last thing is to think about encoding so it can be represented as a printable text (read, a String).\n3. Byte Encoding\nTypical encodings include:\n\nBase64 every character encodes 6bit creating a 33% overhead. Unfortunatly there is no standard implementation in the JDK (there is in Android). But numerous libraries exist that add this. The downside is, that Base64 is not safe for eg. urls and as filename in most file systems requiring additional encoding (e.g. url encoding). Example encoding 16 bytes with padding: XfJhfv3C0P6ag7y9VQxSbw==\nBase32 every character encodes 5bit creating a 40% overhead. This will use A-Z and 2-7 making it reasonably space efficient while being case-insensitive alpha-numeric. Like with Base64 there is no standard implementation in JDK. Example encoding 16 bytes without padding: WUPIL5DQTZGMF4D3NX5L7LNFOY\nBase16 (hex) every character encodes 4bit requiring 2 characters per byte (ie. 16 byte create a string of length 32). Therefore hex is less space efficient than Base32 but is safe to use in most cases (url) since it only uses 0-9 and A to F. Example encoding 16 bytes: 4fa3dd0f57cb3bf331441ed285b27735. See a SO discussion about converting to hex here.\n\nAdditional encodings like Base85 and the exotic Base122 exist with better/worse space efficiency. You can create your own encoding (which basically most answers in this thread do) but I would advise against it, if you don\'t have very specific requirements.\n4. Summary and Example\n\nUse SecureRandom\nUse 16 bytes of possible values\nEncode according to your requirements (usually hex or base32 if you need it to be alpha-numeric)\n\nDon\'t\n\n... use your home brew encoding: better maintainable and readable for others if they see what standard encoding you use instead of weird for loops creating chars at a time.\n... use UUID: you are wasting 6bits of entropy and have verbose string representation\n\nExample: Hex Token Generator\n\n', 'questionId': '41107', 'answerId': '44227131'}

{'answer': u"\nWhat is the best way to implement constants in Java?\n\nOne approach that we should really avoid : using interfaces to define constants.\nCreating a interface specifically to declare constants is really the worst thing : it defeats the reason why interfaces were designed : defining method(s) contract.\nEven if an interface already exists to address a specific need, declaring the constants in them make really not sense as constants should not make part of the API and the contract provided to client classes.\n\nTo simplify, we have broadly 4 valid approaches.\nWith static final String/Integer field :\n\n1) using a class that declare constants inside but not only.\n1 variant) creating a class dedicated to only declare constants.\n\nWith Java 5 enum :\n\n2) declaring the enum in a related purpose class (nested class).\n2 variant) creating the enum alone (not in a outer class).\n\n\nTLDR : Which is the best way and where locate the constants ?\nIn most of cases, the enum way is probably finer than the static final String/Integer way and personally I think that the static final String/Integer way should be used only if we have good reasons to not use enums.\nAnd about where we should declare the constant values, the idea is to search if there exists a class that own a strong semantic and use relationship with constant values. If we find it, we should use it as the constants holder. Otherwise, the constant should be associated to no one particular class.\n\nstatic final String/ static final Integer versus enum \nEnums usage is really a way to strongly considered.\nEnums have a great advantage over String or Integer constant field. \nThey set a stronger compilation constraint. \nIf you define a method that takes the enum as parameter, you can only pass a enum value defined in the enum class(or null). \nWith String and Integer you can substitute them with any values of compatible type and the compilation will be fine even if the value is not a defined constant in the static final String/ static final Integer fields. \nFor example, below two constants defined in a class as static final String fields :\n\nHere a method that expects to have one of these constants as parameter :\n\nYou can invoke it in this way :\n\nor \n\nBut no compilation constraint prevents you from invoking it in this way :\n\nYou would have the error only at runtime and only if you do at a time a check on the transmitted value.\nWith enum, checks are not required as the client could only pass a enum value in a enum parameter.\nFor example, here two values defined in a enum class (so constant out of the box):\n\nHere a method that expects to have one of these enum values as parameter :\n\nYou can invoke it in this way :\n\nor \n\nBut the compilation will never allow you from invoking it in this way :\n\n\nWhere should we declare the constants ?\nIf your application contains an existing class that has a specific and strong functional cohesion with the constant values, the 1) and the 2) appear more intuitive.\nGenerally, it eases the use of the constants if these are declared in the main class that manipulates them or that has a name very natural to guess that we will find it inside.\nFor example in the JDK library, the exponential and pi constant values are   declared in a class that declare not only constant declarations (java.lang.Math).\n\nThe clients using mathematics functions rely often on the Math class.\nSo, they may find constants easily enough and can also remember where E and PI are defined in a very natural way. \nIf your application doesn't contain an existing class that has a very specific and strong functional cohesion with the constant values, the 1 variant) and the 2 variant) ways appear more intuitive.\nGenerally, it doesn't ease the use of the constants if these are declared in one class that manipulates them while we have also 3 or 4 other classes that manipulate them as much as and no one of these classes seems be more natural than others to host constant values.\nHere, defining a custom class to hold only constant values makes sense.\nFor example in the JDK library, the java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit enum is not declared in a specific class as there is not really one and only one JDK specific class that appear as the most intuitive to hold it :\n\nMany classes declared in java.util.concurrent use them :\nBlockingQueue, ArrayBlockingQueue<E>, CompletableFuture, ExecutorService , ... and really no one of them seems more appropriate to hold the enum.\n", 'questionId': '66066', 'answerId': '44452756'}

It is often useful for implementing in-memory caches or indexes i.e key value pairs  For example:\nFor a given user ID, what is their cached name/User object?.\nAlways go with HashMap to perform a lookup.\n\nVector and Hashtable are synchronized and therefore bit slower and  If synchronization is needed, use Collections.synchronizedCollection().\nCheck This for sorted collections.\nHope this hepled.\n', 'questionId': '48442', 'answerId': '44682154'}
