I am migrating to JXTA 2.5 and in the process I am trying to clean up a lot of my use of JXTA. For the most part, I approached JXTA with a just make it work attitude. I used it to jumpstart creating and managing my peer-to-peer overlay network and providing basic communication services. I would like to use it in a more JXTA way since I am making changes to move to 2.5 anyway.\nMy first step would be a basic creation of a custom PeerGroup.

As I understand it, if I do this, when a group with a spec ID matching the GUID is encountered and joined or created it should automatically use the matching object. I should be able to just manually tie a PeerGroup object to the group but this new method using META-INF seems to be a lot easier to manage.\nDoes anyone have any pointers or examples of using this infrastructure for PeerGroup implementation?

A coworker suggested I update JAVA_OPTS in my /etc/profile to include "-Duser.timezone=US/Pacific", which worked (I also saw CATALINA_OPTS, which I updated as well). Actually, I just exported the change into the variables rather than use the new /etc/profile (a reboot later will pick up the changes and I will be golden).\nHowever, I still think there is a better solution... there should be a configuration for Java somewhere that says what timezone it is using, or how it is grabbing the timezone. If someone knows such a setting, that would be awesome, but for now this is a decent workaround.\n\nI am using 1.5, and it is most definitely a DST problem.  As you can see, the time zone is set to not use daylight savings.  My belief is it is generically set to -8 offset rather than the specific Pacific timezone.  Since the generic -8 offset has no daylight savings info, it\'s of course not using it, but the question is, where do I tell Java to use Pacific time zone when it starts up?

{'questionId': '12927', 'question': u"I am calling a vendor's Java API, and on some servers it appears that the JVM goes into a low priority polling loop after logging into the API (CPU at 100% usage).  The same app on other servers does not exhibit this behavior. This happens on WebSphere and Tomcat.  The environment is tricky to set up so it is difficult to try to do something like profiling within Eclipse.\nIs there a way to profile (or some other method of inspecting) an existing Java app running in Tomcat to find out what methods are being executed while it's in this spinwait kind of state?  The app is only executing one method when it gets in this state (vendor's method). Vendor can't replicate the behavior (of course).\n\nUpdate:  \nUsing JConsole I was able to determine who was running and what they were doing.  It took me a few hours to then figure out why it was doing it.  The problem ended up being that the vendor's API jar that was being used did not match exactly to the the database configuration that it was using.  It was defaulting to having tracing and performance monitoring enabled on the servers that had the slight mis-match in configuration.  I used a different jar and all is well.\nSo thanks, Joshua, for your answer. JConsole was extremely easy to setup and use to monitor an existing application. \n@Cringe - I did some experimenting with some of the options you suggested.

{'questionId': '20034', 'question': u'Project Darkstar was the topic of the monthly JavaSIG meeting down at the Google offices in NYC last night.  For those that don\'t know (probably everyone), Project Darkstar is a framework for massively multiplayer online games that attempts to take care of all of the "hard stuff."  The basic idea is that you write your game server logic in such a way that all operations are broken up into tiny tasks.  You pass these tasks to the Project Darkstar framework which handles distributing them to a specific node in the cluster, any concurrency issues, and finally persisting the data.\nApparently doing this kind of thing is a much different problem for video games than it is for enterprise applications.  Jim Waldo, who gave the lecture, claims that MMO games have a DB read/write ratio of 50/50, whereas enterprise apps are more like 90% read, 10% write.  He also claims that most existing MMOs keep everything in memory exlcusively, and only dump to a DB every 6 hours of so.  This means if a server goes down, you would lose all of the work since the last DB dump.\nNow, the project itself sounds really cool, but I don\'t think the industry will accept it.  First, you have to write your server code in Java.  The client code can be written in anything (Jim claims ActionScript 3 is the most popular, follow by C++), but the server stuff has to be Java.  Sounds good to me, but I really get the impression that everyone in the games industry hates Java.\nSecond, unlike other industries where developers prefer to use existing frameworks and libraries, the guys in the games industry seem to like to write everything themselves.  Not only that, they like to rewrite everything for every new game they produce.

{'questionId': '33497', 'question': u'Unchecked exceptions are alright if you want to handle every failure the same way, for example by logging it and skipping to the next request, displaying a message to the user and handling the next event, etc. If this is my use case, all I have to do is catch some general exception type at a high level in my system, and handle everything the same way.\nBut I want to recover from specific problems, and I\'m not sure the best way to approach it with unchecked exceptions. Here is a concrete example.\nSuppose I have a web application, built using Struts2 and Hibernate. If an exception bubbles up to my "action", I log it, and display a pretty apology to the user. But one of the functions of my web application is creating new user accounts, that require a unique user name. If a user picks a name that already exists, Hibernate throws an org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException (an unchecked exception) down in the guts of my system. I\'d really like to recover from this particular problem by asking the user to choose another user name, rather than giving them the same "we logged your problem but for now you\'re hosed" message.\nHere are a few points to consider:\n\nThere a lot of people creating accounts simultaneously. I don\'t want to lock the whole user table between a "SELECT" to see if the name exists and an "INSERT" if it doesn\'t. In the case of relational databases, there might be some tricks to work around this, but what I\'m really interested in is the general case where pre-checking for an exception won\'t work because of a fundamental race condition. Same thing could apply to looking for a file on the file system, etc.\nGiven my CTO\'s propensity for drive-by management induced by reading technology columns in "Inc.", I need a layer of indirection around the persistence mechanism so that I can throw out Hibernate and use Kodo, or whatever, without changing anything except the lowest layer of persistence code. As a matter of fact, there are several such layers of abstraction in my system. How can I prevent them from leaking in spite of unchecked exceptions?\nOne of the declaimed weaknesses of checked exceptions is having to "handle" them in every call on the stack\u2014either by declaring that a calling method throws them, or by catching them and handling them. Handling them often means wrapping them in another checked exception of a type appropriate to the level of abstraction. So, for example, in checked-exception land, a file-system\u2013based implementation of my UserRegistry might catch IOException, while a database implementation would catch SQLException, but both would throw a UserNotFoundException that hides the underlying implementation. How do I take advantage of unchecked exceptions, sparing myself of the burden of this wrapping at each layer, without leaking implementation details?\n\n'}

The end user must be able to download the file from there browser using HTTP.  I don\'t think Flash or Silverlight can save files to the client so as far as I know they won\'t cut it.\nI\'m guessing we will need an ActiveX or Java applet to pull this off.  Something like the download manager that MSDN uses.\nDoes anyone know of a commercial (or free) component that will do that?  We do not want the user to have to install a "browser wide" download manager (like GetRight), we want it to only work with downloading on our site. \nUpdate: Here is some additional info to help clarify what I\'m trying to do.  Most of the files above the 4GB limit would be large HD video files (its for a video editing company).  These will be downloaded by users across the internet, this isn\'t going to be people on a local network.  We want the files to be available via HTTP (some users are going to be behind firewalls that aren\'t going to allow FTP, Bittorrent, etc.).  The will be a library of files the end user could download, so we aren\'t talking about a one time large download.  The will be download different large files on a semi-regular basis.\nSo far Vault that @Edmund-Tay suggested is the closest solution so far.  The only problem is that it doesn\'t work for files larger than 4GB (it instantly fails before starting the download, they are probably using a 32bit integer somewhere that the content length of the file exceeds).\nA java applet (or ActiveX component since the problem only exist in IE) that worked like the article @spoulson linked to would be the best solution, but so far I haven\'t had any luck finding one that does anything like that (multipart downloads, resume, etc.).\nIt looks like we might have to write our own.  Another option would be to write a .Net application (maybe ClickOnce) that is associated with an extension or mime type.  Then the user would actually be downloading a small file from the web server that opens in the exe/ClickOnce app that tells the application what file to download.  That is how the MSDN downloader works.  The end user would then only have to download/install an EXE once.  That would be better than downloading an exe every time they wanted to download a large file.\n'}

If my project can gain from it, fine, but I present it strictly to have something to start a discussion around.\nI've implemented a protocol abstraction which I call 'client' (for legacy reasons) which allows me to access most exposed features using method calls which I am happy with even if it's far from perfect.\nThe features provided by the xmms2 daemon are things like track searching, meta-data retrieval and manipulation, change playback state, load playlists and so on and so forth.\nI'm in the middle of updating to the latest stable release of xmms2, and I figured I might as well fix some of the glaring weaknesses of my current implementation.\nMy plan is to build a better abstraction on top of the protocol interface, one that allows a more natural interaction with the daemon. The current 'model' implementation is hard to use and is frankly quite ugly (not to mention the UI-code which is truly horrible atm).\nToday I have the Tracks interface which I can use to get instances of Track classes based on their id. Searching is performed through the Collections interface (unfortunate namespace clash) which I'd rather move to Tracks, I think.\nAny data can be modified by a third party at any time, and this should be properly reflected in the model and change-notifications distributed\nThese interfaces are exposed when connecting, by returning an object hierarchy that looks like this:\n\nConnection\n\n\nPlayback getPlayback()\n\n\nPlay, pause, jump, current track etc\nExpose playback state changes\n\nTracks getTracks()\n\n\nTrack getTrack(id) etc\nExpose track updates\n\nCollections getCollection()\n\n\nLoad and manipulate playlists or named collections\nQuery media library\nExpose collection updates\n\n\n\n"}

{'questionId': '42828', 'question': u"I will elaborate somewhat. Jsf is kind-of extremely painful for working with from designer's perspective, somewhat in the range of trying to draw a picture while having hands tied at your back, but it is good for chewing up forms and listing lots of data. So sites we are making in my company are jsf admin pages and jsp user pages. Problem occurs when user pages have some complicated forms and stuff and jsf starts kickin' in. \nHere is the question: I'm on pure jsp page. I need to access some jsf page that uses session bean. How can I initialize that bean? If I was on jsf page, I could have some commandLink which would prepare data. Only thing I can come up with is having dummy jsf page that will do the work and redirect me to needed jsf page, but that's kind of ugly, and I don't want to end up with 50 dummy pages. I would rather find some mechanism to reinitialize bean that is already in session with some wanted parameters.\nEdit: some more details. In this specific situation, I have a tests that are either full or filtered. It's a same test with same logic and everything, except if test is filtered, it should eliminate some questions depending on answers. Upon a clicking a link, it should start a requested test in one of the two modes. Links are parts of main menu-tree and are visible on many sibling jsp pages. My task is to have 4 links: testA full, testA filtered, testB full, testB filtered, that all lead on same jsf page and TestFormBean should be reinitialized accordingly.\nEdit: I've researched facelets a bit, and while it won't help me now, I'll definitely keep that in mind for next project.\n"}

{'questionId': '43808', 'question': u"I have a distributed Java application running on 5 application servers. The servers all use the same Oracle 9i database running on a 6th machine.\nThe application need to prefetch a batch of 100 IDs from a sequence. It's relatively easy to do in a single-threaded, non-distributed environment, you can just issue these queries:\n\nThe first select fetches the first sequence ID that the application can use, the second select returns the last one that can be used.\nThings get way more interesting in a multithreaded environment. You can't be sure that before the second select another thread doesn't increase the sequence by 100 again. This issue can be solved by synchronizing the access on the Java side - you only let one thread begin fetching the IDs at one time.\nThe situation becomes really hard when you can't synchronize because parts of the application doesn't run on the same JVM, not even on the same physical machine. I found some references on forums that others have problems with solving this problem too, but none of the answers are really working not to mention being reasonable.\nCan the community provide a solution for this problem?\nSome more information:\n\nI can't really play with the transaction isolation levels. I use JPA and the change would affect the entire application, not only the prefetching queries and that's not acceptable for me.\nOn PostgreSQL I could do the following:\nselect setval('seq', nextval('seq') + n - 1 )\nThe solution by Matthew works when you can use a fixed increment value (which is perfectly acceptable in my case).

{'questionId': '51266', 'question': u"I have an application that's a mix of Java and C++ on Solaris. The Java aspects of the code run the web UI and establish state on the devices that we're talking to, and the C++ code does the real-time crunching of data coming back from the devices. Shared memory is used to pass device state and context information from the Java code through to the C++ code. The Java code uses a PostgreSQL database to persist its state.\nWe're running into some pretty severe performance bottlenecks, and right now the only way we can scale is to increase memory and CPU counts. We're stuck on the one physical box due to the shared memory design.\n\nThe really big hit here is being taken by the C++ code. The web interface is fairly lightly used to configure the devices; where we're really struggling is to handle the data volumes that the devices deliver once configured.\nEvery piece of data we get back from the device has an identifier in it which points back to the device context, and we need to look that up. Right now there's a series of shared memory objects that are maintained by the Java/UI code and referred to by the C++ code, and that's the bottleneck. Because of that architecture we cannot move the C++ data handling off to another machine. We need to be able to scale out so that various subsets of devices can be handled by different machines, but then we lose the ability to do that context lookup, and that's the problem I'm trying to resolve: how to offload the real-time data processing to other boxes while still being able to refer to the device context.\nI should note we have no control over the protocol used by the devices themselves, and there is no possible chance that situation will change.\n\nWe know we need to move away from this to be able to scale out by adding more machines to the cluster, and I'm in the early stages of working out exactly how we'll do this.\nRight now I'm looking at Terracotta as a way of scaling out the Java code, but I haven't got as far as working out how to scale out the C++ to match.\nAs well as scaling for performance we need to consider high availability as well. The application needs to be available pretty much the whole time -- not absolutely 100%, which isn't cost effective, but we need to do a reasonable job of surviving a machine outage.\nIf you had to undertake the task I've been given, what would you do?\nEDIT: Based on the data provided by @john channing, i'm looking at both GigaSpaces and Gemstone.

{'questionId': '64781', 'question': u'I have a web application that receives messages through an HTTP interface, e.g.:\n\nThis request contains the ID of the sender, the ID of the recipient and the text of the message.\nThis message should be processed like:\n\nfinding the matching User object for both the source and the destination from the database\ncreating a tree of objects: a Message that contains a field for the message text and two User objects for the source and the destination\npersisting this tree to a database.\n\nThe tree will be loaded by other applications that I can\'t touch.\nI use Oracle as the backing database and JPA with Toplink for the database handling tasks. If possible, I\'d stay with these.\nWithout much optimization I can achieve ~30 requests/sec throughput in my environment. That\'s not much, I\'d require ~300 requests/sec. So I measured where the performance bottleneck is and found that the calls to em.persist() takes most of the time. If I simply comment out that line, the throughput go well over 1000 requests/sec.\nI tried to write a small test application that used simple JDBC calls to persist 1 million messages to the same database. I used batching, meaning I did 100 inserts then a commit, and repeated until all the records was in the database. I measured ~500 requests/sec throughput in this scenario, that would meet my needs.\nIt is clear that I need to optimize insert performance here. However as I mentioned earlier I would like to keep using JPA and Toplink for this, not pure JDBC.\nDo you know a way to create batch inserts with JPA and Toplink? Can you recommend any other technique for improving JPA persist performance?\nADDITIONAL INFO:\n"requests/sec" means here: total number of requests / total time from beginning of test to last record written to database.\nI tried to make the calls to em.persist() asynchronous by creating an in-memory queue between the servlet stuff and the persister. It helped the performance greatly. However the queue did grow really fast and as the application will receive ~200 requests/second continuously, It is not an acceptable solution for me.\nIn this decoupled approach I collected requests for 100 msec and called em.persist() on all collected items before commiting the transaction. The EntityManagerFactory is cached between each transaction.\n'}

{'questionId': '68109', 'question': u"My professor did an informal benchmark on a little program and the Java times were: 1.7 seconds for the first run, and 0.8 seconds for the runs thereafter.  \n\nIs this due entirely to the loading of the runtime environment into the operating environment ?\nOR \nIs it influenced by Java's optimizing the code and storing the results of those optimizations (sorry, I don't know the technical term for that)?\n\n"}
{'questionId': '68113', 'question': u"I've just inherited a java application that needs to be installed as a service on XP and vista. It's been about 8 years since I've used windows in any form and I've never had to create a service, let alone from something like a java app (I've got a jar for the app and a single dependency jar - log4j).  What is the magic necessary to make this run as a service?  I've got the source, so code modifications, though preferably avoided, are possible.\n"}
