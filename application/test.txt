This is not a duplicate of Disable output buffering - the linked question is attempting unbuffered output, while this is more general. The top answers in that question are too powerful or involved for this one (they're not good answers for this), and this question can be found on Google by a relative newbie.
They did not backport the flush argument to Python 2.7 So if you're using Python 2 (or less than 3.3), and want code that's compatible with both 2 and 3, may I suggest the following compatibility code. 
I recommend not inheriting from file and then delegating to stdout
Why not try using an unbuffered file?
Even if StackOverflow would allow me to hyperlink to the s3 protocol scheme, it wouldn't do you any good in locating the resource. Because it Identifies a Resource, fig. 1 is a valid URI. It is also a valid URN, because Amazon requires that the bucket (their term for the authority portion of the URI) be unique across datacenters. It is helpful in locating it, but it does not indicate the datacenter. Therefore it does not work as a URL.
This is one of the most confusing and possibly irrelevant topics I've encountered as a web professional. As I understand it, a URI is a description of something, following an accepted format, that can define both or either the unique name (identification) of something and its location. There are two basic subsets - URLs, which define location (especially to a browser trying to look up a webpage) and URNs, which define the unique name of something. I tend to think of URNs as being similar to GUIDs. They are simply a standardized methodology for providing unique names for things. As in the namespace declarative that uses a company's name - it's not like there is a resource sitting on a server somewhere to correspond to that line of text - it simply uniquely identifies something. I also tend to completely avoid the term URI and discuss things only in terms of URL or URN as appropriate, because it causes so much confusion. 
The question we should really try answering for people isn't so much the semantics, but how to identify when encountering the terms whether or not there is any practical difference in them that will change the approach to a programming situation. For example, if someone corrects me in conversation and says, "oh, that's not a URL it's a URI" I know they're full of it. If someone says "we're using a URN to define the resource" I'm more likely to understand we are only naming it uniquely, not locating it on a server.
One of HashMap's subclasses is LinkedHashMap, so in the event that you'd want predictable iteration order (which is insertion order by default), you could easily swap out the HashMap for a LinkedHashMap. This wouldn't be as easy if you were using Hashtable.
I'm not that into dynamic programming languages, but I've written my fair share of JavaScript code. I never really got my head around this prototype-based programming, does any one know how this works?
In the simplest terms, git pull does a git fetch followed by a git merge. This operation never changes any of your own local branches under refs/heads, and is safe to do without changing your working copy.
That depends on the size of your repository and how you forked it. If it's quite a big repository you may have wanted to manage it in a special way (e.g. drop history). Basically you can get differences between current and upstream versions, commit them and then cherry pick back to master. Try reading this one. It describes how to handle big Git repositories and how to upstream them with latest changes.
This is branch prediction. I admit it's not the best analogy since the train could just signal the direction with a flag. But in computers, the processor doesn't know which direction a branch will go until the last moment.
I recently forked a project and applied several fixes. I then created a pull request which was then accepted. A few days later another change was made by another contributor. So my fork doesn't contain that change... How can I get that change into my fork? Do I need to delete and re-create my fork when I have further changes to contribute? Or is there an update button?
